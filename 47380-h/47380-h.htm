Hooghly.</p></blockquote>

<p class="drop-cap3"><span class="smcap1">In</span> 1841 British and Indian troops occupied Cabul; but throughout
Affghanistan the aspect of things political was alarming. In Scinde
the Ameers were defiant and hostile. The Punjab in a state of disturbance
and convulsion; law and order had ceased; isolated murders
and massacres instigated by opposing claimants to the throne left vacant
in 1839, and since that time occupied by a prince against whom the
insurrectionary movement was now directed by chiefs, some of whom
were inimical to British interests.</p>

<p>Military reinforcements on a large scale were dispatched from England.
Great, accordingly, the activity at Chatham, then the only depot
whence recruits and young officers were sent to regiments serving in
India. The depot then at Warley was for soldiers of the Honourable
Company’s service.</p>

<p>Into the General Hospital at Fort Pitt were received military invalids
from India as from all other foreign stations. There they were treated
for their several ailments; thence discharged to join their respective
depots, or from the service on such pensions as they were deemed
entitled to by length of service and regimental character. Then the
period of engagement was for life, otherwise twenty-one years in the
infantry, twenty-four in the mounted branches.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_2" id="Page_2">2</a></span>
There young medical men nominated for appointment to the army
underwent a course of training, more or less long, according to individual
circumstances, for the special duties before them; meanwhile
they received no pay, wore no uniform; they dined at mess, paid mess
subscriptions, and were subject to martial law.</p>

<p>Professional education included requirements for diplomas, and in
addition, special subjects relating to military medicine, surgery, and
management of troops. Nominations for appointments were given by
old officers or other men whose social position was a guarantee in regard
to character and fitness of their nominees for the position sought by
them; certificates by professors and teachers under whom they studied
were submitted to the responsible <span class="locked">authority<a name="FNanchor_1" id="FNanchor_1" href="#Footnote_1" class="fnanchor">1</a></span> at the War Office, with
whom rested their selection. Thus in effect a combined system of
patronage and competition was in force.</p>

<p>With anxious interest a small group of expectants awaited the arrival
of the coach by which in those days afternoon letters and evening
papers from the metropolis were conveyed. Eagerly was <i>The Gazette</i>
scanned when, close upon the hour of midnight, the papers were
delivered. Great was the pride and rejoicing with which some of our
number read the announcement relating to them; great the disappointment
of those who were not so included. The regiment to which I had
the honour of being appointed was the 3rd, or “Buffs,” the depot of
which formed part of the Provisional Battalion then occupying Forton
<span class="locked">Barracks.<a name="FNanchor_2" id="FNanchor_2" href="#Footnote_2" class="fnanchor">2</a></span></p>

<p>The duties assigned to young medical officers were unimportant&mdash;&#8203;initiatory
rather than definite in kind. Careful watch and superintendence
on the part of official seniors gave us an opportunity of learning
various points relative to practice, as well as to routine and discipline,
to be turned to account&mdash;&#8203;or otherwise&mdash;&#8203;in the career upon which we
were entering. But the process of “breaking in” was not without its
disagreeables. Courtesy towards young officers on the part of their
seniors, military or medical, was a quality rare at Chatham, but where
met with in isolated instances was the more appreciated, and remembered
in subsequent years. The “system” of training in force tended
rather to break than bend the sapling.</p>

<p>Thus did three months pass away. Then came an order of readiness
to embark with the detachment of recruits next to sail. Although
about to proceed with those pertaining to what was now “my own
regiment,” official regulations required that my appointment to<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_3" id="Page_3">3</a></span>
charge of them should have the authority of “The Honourable Court
of Directors,” and that to obtain it, personal application must be made
at their old historical house in Leadenhall Street&mdash;&#8203;a formality which
was gone through with ease and success. This is what the appointment
in question implied:&mdash;&#8203;Not only did I receive the free passage
to which I was entitled, my daily rate of <span class="locked">pay<a name="FNanchor_3" id="FNanchor_3" href="#Footnote_3" class="fnanchor">3</a></span> running on the while,
minus £5 deducted “for messing,” but was privileged to occupy the
second best cabin on board, and at the end of the voyage to receive in
rupees a sum equivalent to fifteen shillings per head for officers and
soldiers landed, and half a guinea for each woman and child. In those
“golden days” the sterling value of the rupee was at par.</p>

<p>The ordeal of “inspection” was duly performed, the requirements
on board declared “satisfactory,” the formal report to that effect transmitted
to the authorities. My personal knowledge of those requirements
was absolutely <i>nil</i>. How much more definite that of other
members of the Inspecting Committee, was soon to be judged of. For
example: side or stern ports there were none, deck ventilators being
considered sufficient. Food stores comprised casks of salted beef and
pork; tins of soup and bouillé, potatoes and other vegetables, some
dried, some tinned; pickles and lime juice, bread, otherwise hard
biscuit, destined ere many weeks had elapsed to become mouldy and
honeycombed by weevils. There were bags of flour, peas, and raisins;
an ample supply of tobacco; also of rum and porter, to be issued to
the troops as a daily ration. The water tanks and a series of casks on
deck had been filled&mdash;&#8203;so it was said&mdash;&#8203;from the Thames below London
Bridge, when the tide was at its lowest.</p>

<p>The day of departure arrived. The detachment of which I was an
unit marched away from Chatham Barracks, through Rochester, Strood,
and so by road to Gravesend. There it was conveyed on board the
<i>Indian</i>; twenty-four hours allowed us to settle down on board; the
ship then taken in tow by steamer; we are on our voyage.</p>

<p>A fortnight elapsed; we were no farther on our way than off the
coast of Spain. The novelties of first experience afforded subject of
observation and thought: those which most impressed us, the clear
moonlight, the starry galaxy of the heavens, the Milky Way, the cloudless
sky, the phosphorescence of the undulating sea through which our
ship slowly glided; the masses of living things, chiefly medusæ, that
floated fathoms deep in ocean. During daylight many land birds flew
over us or rested on the rigging.</p>

<p>Small though our party was, it comprised its proportion of men<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_4" id="Page_4">4</a></span>
typical in their several ways. The commander of the vessel, soured
with life, disappointed in career, tired of sea life, but unable to quit his
profession. One of the ship’s officers, a young man of deeply religious
convictions. An ancient subaltern, inured to the chagrin of having been
several times purchased over by men of less service but more fortunate
than himself in worldly means. The lady’s man, pretentious and
vapid, given to solos on a guitar; the instrument adorned with many
coloured ribbons, to each of which he attached a legend; his cabin
decorated with little bits of “work,” cards, and trinkets, for as yet
photographs had not been invented. The irascible person, ready to take
offence at trifles, and in other ways uncertain.</p>

<p>A month on board; the Canary Islands faintly seen in the distance.
Already heat and stuffiness ’tween decks so unpleasant that carpenters
were set to work to cut out stern ports for ventilation. Our progress so
slow that with all sails set a ship’s boat was launched, in which some of
our numbers amused themselves by rowing round the vessel.</p>

<p>Two months, and we still north of the Equator. Various reasons
given for tedious progress, among others light airs, contrary winds,
adverse currents. But none of these explained the fact of our being
passed by vessels, some of which, on the horizon astern of us in the
morning, were hull down on that ahead ere daylight vanished. That
our ship was alluded to as “a worthless old tub” need now be no
matter of surprise.</p>

<p>Not more than one-third of our distance to be run as yet got over;
prospects as regarded the remainder by no means happy. The unwelcome
announcement made that all hands, including crew and troops,
must submit to reduced allowance of food and water. Of the latter,
the full allowance per head per day for cooking and all other
purposes was seven pints, now to be reduced to six. No wonder that
the announcement was not received with tokens of approval.</p>

<p>Looking back to conditions as described in notes taken at the time,
the contrast so presented between those which were then deemed
sufficient for troops on board ship, and those which now exist may not
be without some historical interest. Space ’tween decks so <span class="locked">limited,<a name="FNanchor_4" id="FNanchor_4" href="#Footnote_4" class="fnanchor">4</a></span> that
with men’s hammocks slung, those who on duty had to make their
way along at night were forced to stoop almost to the attitude of the
ordinary quadruped. The “sick bay” on the port side, close to the
main hatch, directly exposed to rain from starboard; except a canvas
screen, no separation between the quarters of unmarried and those of
married; no separate accommodation for sick women or children; no
prison set apart for the refractory. All over the ship myriads of cockroaches;<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_5" id="Page_5">5</a></span>
these insects, especially lively at night, supplied to men and
officers excitement and exercise, as, slipper in hand, they hunted them
whenever the pale light given by the ship’s lamps enabled them to do
so. Cleanliness of decks and fittings was to some extent effected by
means of dry scrubbing. The use of Burnett’s <span class="locked">Solution<a name="FNanchor_5" id="FNanchor_5" href="#Footnote_5" class="fnanchor">5</a></span> substituted
the odour of the compound so named for that of humanity. By means
of iron fumigators in which was burning tar, the atmosphere of ’tween
decks was purified, due precautions taken to minimise the risks of fire
attending the process. Tubs and hose on deck supplied ample means
for the morning “souse.”</p>

<p>A carefully chosen library provided for the use of our men was
placed on board by the Indian authorities; it was highly appreciated
and generally made use of. Among the troops, games of all sorts were
encouraged, their selection left to men’s own choice. In working the
ship ready hands were at all times available. Gymnastics and feats
of strength were in high favour, and so, with the routine of guards,
parades, inspections, and so forth, daytime was filled up. In the
evenings, songs, recitations, theatrical performances, and instrumental
music were indulged till the bugle sounded “lights out.”</p>

<p>Officers had their ways of passing the time. They included games,
gymnastics, bets, practical jokes (of all degrees of silliness), cock
fighting, wild and dangerous adventures in the rigging, and on Saturday
evenings, toasts, then usual on such occasions, enthusiastically
“honoured.” A weekly newspaper was set on foot; the works of Scott,
Shakespeare, and Pope, among other authors, carefully studied, and
discussions, more or less profitable, held on their contents.</p>

<p>Sighting, signalling, and hailing ships was a favourite amusement as
opportunity occurred. By some of those homeward bound we dispatched
letters, with passengers on board others we exchanged visits,
strange as such ceremonies may seem to those now acquainted only
with modern twenty-knot floating steam palaces. While paying such a
visit to a ship five months out from China, we learned the “news” that
Canton had been captured (on May 25&ndash;27, 1841) by the forces
under command of Sir Hugh Gough.</p>

<p>In near proximity to the Equator we came upon a ship, the <i>Cambridge</i>,
disabled, her topmasts carried away in a sudden squall two nights
previous. The resolve to stand by and give assistance was quickly
taken. Boats were lowered, parties of sailors and recruits, accompanied
by some officers, were soon on board. Within a few hours defects were
made good as far as that was practicable; meantime night had closed
in, a somewhat fresh breeze sprung up, clouds obscured the sky, and<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_6" id="Page_6">6</a></span>
so the return to our ship was by no means accomplished without
danger.</p>

<p>The distance to be got over was still great before the ship could
reach Table Bay and renewed supplies obtained. The health of all on
board had so far remained good, notwithstanding all the drawbacks
experienced. The likelihood, however, that this happy state of things
might suddenly come to an end became to me a source of what was
the first sense of official anxiety with which I had been acquainted.</p>

<p>Excepting two somewhat elderly non-commissioned officers, specially
put on board the better to ensure discipline among our recruits, all
others were as yet but partly tutored in military duties and order.
Unwilling obedience had from the first been shown by several of their
number; then came irregularities, quarrels, and fights among themselves.
Nor were the few married women on board ideal patterns of
gentleness, either in speech or behaviour.</p>

<p>Among the crew were men whose antecedents, so far as they could
be ascertained, were of the most questionable kind, and whose conduct
on board had, from the first, been suspicious. Between them and
kindred spirits among the recruits, it appeared that an understanding
had been come to to have what they called “a disturbance” on board.
Those intentions having come to the ears of the officers, with the
further information that fully ninety men were implicated, preparations
were made for emergencies: arm-racks fitted up in the saloon; fire-arms
burnished; ammunition seen to; non-commissioned officers instructed as
to their duties. But an occurrence which now happened distracted
attention from the so-called plot, whether real or imaginary did not
transpire.</p>

<p>Our entrance into tropical latitudes, some three weeks previous, had
been duly announced by “Neptune,” who, selecting the period of first
night watch for the ceremony, welcomed us from amidst a flare of
blue lights on the forecastle, on our coming to his dominions. Having
done so, he returned to his element; his car a burning tar-barrel, which
we continued to watch as it seemed to float astern, until all was darkness
again. On board, “offerings” had to be made to the sea-god,
half-sovereigns and bottles of rum, sent to the fo’c’s’le, being those most
appreciated.</p>

<p>While yet in the first degree of south latitude, the sea-god, accompanied
by his court officials, announced their arrival on board, the whole
personified by members of the ship’s crew, appropriately attired in
accordance with their respective official positions. The ceremony of
“initiating” the “children” was quickly in progress, the chief ceremonies
connected therewith including shaving, “bathing,” besides some<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_7" id="Page_7">7</a></span>
others by no means pleasant to their subjects. One of our young
recruits strongly resisted the ordeal through which several of his comrades
had passed. He succeeded in making his escape from his
captors, and quickly mounting the ship’s railing, thence plunged into
the sea, to the consternation and horror of us all. The vessel was
instantly “put about,” a boat lowered, but search for him was in vain.
The occurrence was, indeed, a melancholy outcome of what was
intended to be a scene of amusement. But the spirits of young men
were light, and ere many hours had elapsed, the song and dance were
in progress, as if the event had not occurred. A Court of Inquiry followed
in due time, and then the incident was forgotten.</p>

<p>We were now approaching Table Bay. Great was the interest and
admiration with which we looked upon Table Mountain, as its grandeur
became more and more distinctly revealed. Hardly less was our
estimate of the Blue Berg range, by which the distant view was
bounded. Soon we were among the shipping, and at anchor.</p>

<p>Our ship was soon surrounded by boats, that seemed to come in
shoals from shore; some conveying fruit and curiosities for sale, others
suspected of carrying commodities less innocuous in kind. But sentries,
already placed at gangways and other points on deck, prevented traffic
between our men and the small craft. The aspect of boats and
their crews was alike new and strange to most of us: the former,
striped with gaudy colours, red, black, and white; the latter, representing
several nationalities, including English, Dutch, Malay, East Indian, and
typical African, their several styles of costume no less various than
themselves.</p>

<p>Some of our number, proceeding ashore, stood for the first time
on foreign ground. Cape Town presented a series of wide, regularly
arranged streets, intersecting each other, their sides sheltered by foliage
trees. Flat-roofed houses, coated with white plaster, were nearly invariable
in their uniformity. Great wagons, drawn by teams of oxen,
from six to twelve in number&mdash;&#8203;and even more&mdash;&#8203;were being driven
along by Malays, armed with whips of alarming proportions; though,
fortunately for the beasts of burthen, they were little used. Crowds of
pedestrians were on the thoroughfares, interspersed with guardians of
the peace, the latter dressed after the manner of their kind in London.
It was the month of December; but the temperature was that of
summer; the heat oppressive, as we continued our excursion.</p>

<p>Part of that excursion was to Constantia. On the right, the great
mountain, rising to a height of three thousand feet; the space between
its base and the road along which we drove thickly covered by forest
and undergrowth, the whole comprising oaks, silver and other pines,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_8" id="Page_8">8</a></span>
geraniums, pomegranates, and heaths, interspersed with herbaceous
plants bearing gorgeously coloured flowers. At intervals there were
richly cultivated fields and valleys; on or near them attractive-looking
houses, many having attached to the latter no less handsome
gardens. The road was thickly occupied by vehicles and pedestrians;
among the whites, a considerable proportion of well-looking individuals
of the fair sex. There was, in fact, a general aspect of activity and of
prosperity.</p>

<p>The ordeal of “reporting ourselves” to the authorities was gone
through: our reception by one, whose surname indicated Dutch
origin, ungracious and supercilious; by the departmental chief so
kindly, as by contrast to make an impression upon us, but partially
inured to official ways as we then were. Meanwhile, the necessary
steps were in progress for placing on board our ship the much-needed
supplies of food materials and of water.</p>

<p>Among vessels that anchored in the bay during our detention, there
was the ship <i>Lloyds</i>, having on board emigrants from England to New
Zealand. When first they began their voyage, they numbered eighty
women and 117 children; but so appalling had been the mortality
among them that, of the children, fifty-seven had died. In all parts of
the space occupied by passengers, sickness and distress in various
shapes prevailed. Children, apparently near to death, lay in cots by the
side of their prostrate mothers, whose feebleness rendered them unable
to give the necessary aid to their infants. A state of indescribable filth
existed everywhere; ventilation there was none in the proper sense.
Women and children affected with measles in very severe form,
that disease having been brought on board in the persons of some of
those embarking; others suffered from low fever, and some from scurvy,
which had recently appeared among them. The family of the medical
man on board had suffered like the others, one of his children having
died. On the deck of the ship lay two coffins, containing bodies of
the dead, preparatory to being taken on shore for burial. The entire
scene presented by the ship, the saddest with which, so far, I had
become acquainted.</p>

<p>In Table Bay we again met the <i>Cambridge</i> already mentioned, that
vessel arriving shortly after our own had anchored. In a sense we, the
passengers of both, greeted each other as old friends; visits were interchanged,
then leave was taken of each other with expressions of good
wishes. By-and-by there came to anchor the ship <i>Nanking</i>, having
on board recruits belonging to the service of the Honourable Company.
Greetings and cheers were interchanged; for were we not all alike
proceeding on a career, hopeful indeed, but as yet uncertain?</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_9" id="Page_9">9</a></span>
In the Castle, a short distance from Cape Town, the 25th Regiment,
or Borderers, was stationed, and in accordance with the hospitable
custom of the time, an invitation to dinner with the officers was
received on board. The party on that festive occasion numbered
seventy, the majority guests like ourselves, and now the circumstance
is mentioned as showing the scale upon which such entertainments
were given.</p>

<p>Invited to the house of an Afrikander <span class="locked">Dutchman<a name="FNanchor_6" id="FNanchor_6" href="#Footnote_6" class="fnanchor">6</a></span>, we found ourselves
in large airy rooms, destitute of carpets, with polished floors; wall
space reduced to a series of intervals between doors and windows;
the arrangements new to us, but suited to climatic conditions of the
place. Little attentions shown by, added to personal attractions of,
lady members of the family naturally enough left their impression on
young susceptibilities.</p>

<p>Very interesting also, though in a different way, was our visit to the
house of Baron von Ludovigberg. Elegantly furnished, rooms so
arranged as to be readily transformed into one large hall, everything
in and around marking a life of ease and comfort. His garden,
situated in Kolf Street, extensive, elegantly laid out, with large
collection of plants indigenous and foreign; at intervals fountains and
ornamental lakes. In the latter were thousands of gold fish, so tame
as to approach and feed from the hand of an attendant; to the sound
of a handbell rung by him they crowded, though on seeing us they
kept at a distance. To the sound of the same bell when rung by
us they would approach, but not come near the strangers.</p>

<p>Our voyage resumed, away eastward we sailed. Sixteen days
without noteworthy incident; then sighted the island of Amsterdam,
from which point, as the captain expressed it, he began to make his
northing.</p>

<p>Another interval of monotonous sea life. At daybreak we found
that in close proximity to us was a barque, the <i>Vanguard</i>, on board
of which there was disturbance amounting to mutiny among the
crew. The <span class="locked">captain<a name="FNanchor_7" id="FNanchor_7" href="#Footnote_7" class="fnanchor">7</a></span> signalled for assistance. A party of our young
soldiers, under command of an officer, proceeded on board, removed
the recalcitrant men to our ship, some of our sailors taking their place,
and so both vessels continued their way to Calcutta.</p>

<p>Again was the unwelcome announcement made that short allowance
of food and water was imminent, to be averted by progress of our
vessel becoming more rapid than it had hitherto been. The<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_10" id="Page_10">10</a></span>
tedium of the voyage had told upon us; idleness had produced its
usual effect. Chafing against authority and slow decay of active good
fellowship became too apparent; all were tired of each other.</p>

<p>Another interval. From the mast-head comes the welcome sound,
“Land on the starboard bow.” Soon we come in view of low-lying
shore, over which hangs a haze in which outlines of objects are
indistinct. What is seen, however, indicates that our ship is out of
reckoning; that, as for some time past suspected, something has gone
wrong with the chronometers. Wisely, the captain determines to
proceed no farther for the present, until able to determine our precise
position. A day and night pass, then is descried a ship in the distance
westward. We proceed in that direction, and ere many hours are
over exchange signals with a pilot brig.</p>

<p>Twenty-four weeks had elapsed since the pilot left us in the Downs;
now the corresponding functionary boards our ship off the Sandheads.
We are eager for news. He has much to tell, but of a nature
sad as unexpected. The envoy at Cabul, Sir William Macnaughten,
murdered by the hand of Akbar Khan; the 44th Regiment annihilated,
part of a force comprising 4,500 fighting men and 12,000 camp-followers
who had started on their disastrous retreat from Cabul
towards the Khyber Pass; one only survivor, Dr. Bryden, who
carried tidings of the disaster to Jellalabad. Another item was
that several officers, ladies, and children were in the hands of the
Affghan chief.</p>

<p>Progress against the current of Hooghly River was slow, steam
employed only while crossing the dreaded “James and Mary” shoal;
for then tugs were scarce, their use expensive. Three days so passed;
the first experience of tropical scenery pleasant to the eye, furnishing
at the same time ample subject for remark and talk. On either side
jungle, cultivated plots of ground, palms, bamboos, buffaloes and cattle
of other kinds. In slimy ooze gigantic gavials; in the river dead bodies
of animals and human beings, vultures and crows perched upon and
tearing their decomposing flesh. Native boats come alongside; their
swarthy, semi-naked crews scream and gesticulate wildly as they offer
for sale fruit and other commodities. Our rigging is crowded with
brahminee kites and other birds; gulls and terns swarm around. The
prevailing damp heat is oppressive. Now the beautiful suburb of
Garden Reach is on our right; on our left the Botanic Garden; the
City of Palaces is ahead of us; we are at anchor off Princep’s Ghat.</p>

<p>The “details,” as in official language our troops collectively are called,
were transferred to country boats of uncouth look, and so conveyed
to Chinsurah, then a depot for newly arrived recruits. Our actual<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_11" id="Page_11">11</a></span>
numbers so transferred equalled those originally embarked, two lives
lost during our voyage being made up for by two births on board.
Sanitation, in modern significance of the term, had as substitute
the arrangements&mdash;&#8203;or want of them&mdash;&#8203;already mentioned; yet no
special illness occurred; my first charge ended satisfactorily.</p>

<p class="drop-cap3"><span class="smcap1">First</span> impressions of this our first station in India, recorded at
the time, were:&mdash;&#8203;Houses of mud, roofs consisting of reeds,
fronts open from end to end; members of families within squatting,
infants sprawling, in a state of nudity, upon earthen floors
made smooth and polished by means of cowdung applied in a liquid
state; while to outside walls cakes of the same material are in process
of drying, to be thereafter used as fuel by Hindoos. Gardens and
cultivated fields abound; flowering trees and shrubs, cocoa palms,
banana bushes, clumps of bamboo, rise above dense undergrowth
of succulent plants. A heavy, oppressive atmosphere, pervaded by
odours, sweet and otherwise, has a depressing effect, as if conditions
were not altogether wholesome. European houses according to
Holland model, terraces and gardens giving to them an attractive
and elegant appearance, indicating the importance of the place while
in the hands of the Dutch, prior to <span class="locked">date<a name="FNanchor_8" id="FNanchor_8" href="#Footnote_8" class="fnanchor">8</a></span> of the treaty in accordance
with which it was by them exchanged for Java. An extensive range
of spacious barracks and supplementary buildings added much to the
beauty of the station.</p>

<p>Before many days were over several of our young lads had fallen
victims to cholera. In this our first experience of that disease we
had access to no one capable of giving aid and advice; we were left
to individual judgment, and it altogether astray as to the appropriate
method in our emergency. For a time, out of our small party death
claimed several daily victims; young wives were thus left widows, young
children orphans.</p>

<p>Glad to receive orders of readiness to resume progress by river
to next stage of our journey. Then arrived two senior officers,&mdash;&#8203;<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_13" id="Page_13">13</a></span>one
to take military <span class="locked">command;<a name="FNanchor_9" id="FNanchor_9" href="#Footnote_9" class="fnanchor">9</a></span> the other, departmental charge of
our detachment. Country boats provided as before, others of better
kind for officers. Our unwieldy fleet started at the appointed <span class="locked">time;<a name="FNanchor_10" id="FNanchor_10" href="#Footnote_10" class="fnanchor">10</a></span>
the boats comprising it straggled irregularly across the river, and
having gained the opposite bank, there made fast for the night.</p>

<p>Early next morning it was in movement. Mid-day heat became
oppressive. One of the soldiers was prostrated by cholera, another
by sun fever. Inquiry revealed the unpleasant fact that the
“experienced” officer recently appointed for the purpose had made
no arrangements whatever for sick. Those fallen ill were now sent in
small boats back towards Chinsurah; and so we continued our river
progress, steps being taken to have deficient requirements sent on
without delay.</p>

<p>Next evening was far advanced ere they arrived. The numbers of
our sick had increased, several deaths taken place, some with
appalling rapidity in the absence of means of help. The great heat
prevailing made early interment necessary. Graves had to be hastily
made in groves of trees near the river bank; to them the dead were
committed, our fleet continuing its progress, sailing or <span class="locked">tracking<a name="FNanchor_11" id="FNanchor_11" href="#Footnote_11" class="fnanchor">11</a></span>
according to wind and current. After night had fallen, the blaze of
funeral pyres on the river banks told their tale of pestilence.</p>

<p>For several days mortality was great in our small party, and among
the native boatmen. As deaths occurred among the latter, the bodies
were simply left on the bank to be devoured by jackals, dogs, and
vultures, numbers of which were in wait for prey. Some of our
boats sprung leaks, and so became useless; nor was it an easy matter
to get them replaced. Men and stores had to be got out as best
they could and disposed of among others&mdash;&#8203;proceedings by no means
easy under then present circumstances.</p>

<p>At last there came an interval in which the malign influence of our
invisible enemy seemed as if withheld. While gliding upwards against
the silent river current, suddenly from one of the men’s boats there
burst a mass of thick smoke, speedily followed by flame, and within
the space of a few minutes nothing except the charred framework
remained. How, or by what means, the occupants of the boat escaped
did not transpire; that they did so was fortunate for themselves and
satisfactory to all, though the accident, subsequently ascertained to have
resulted from their own carelessness, destroyed their entire kits and
other belongings.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_14" id="Page_14">14</a></span>
Short was our respite. Suddenly and fatally was our detachment
again struck, several deaths by cholera occurring in quick succession.
Our somewhat eventful “voyage” was near its end, when in mid-stream
two of our boats came violently in collision with each other,
considerable mutual damage being the result. An unfortunate panic
occurred among the recruits on board, one of whom leapt overboard
and so disappeared. Soon afterwards our journey was at an
end, it having occupied eleven days; we arrived at Berhampore.</p>

<p>Near to the spacious range of barracks in which our young soldiers
were accommodated were lines occupied by a native <span class="locked">regiment,<a name="FNanchor_12" id="FNanchor_12" href="#Footnote_12" class="fnanchor">12</a></span>&mdash;&#8203;at
that time reputed to be of distinguished loyalty to Jân Kompanee,
with whose liberal dealings towards its own proper servants all were
so well pleased. In others were invalids, soldiers’ wives and children
pertaining to <span class="locked">regiments<a name="FNanchor_13" id="FNanchor_13" href="#Footnote_13" class="fnanchor">13</a></span> employed in the war proceeding against China;
many as yet unaware that they had been made widows and orphans
by the climate of Chusan and coast generally.</p>

<p>Here the conduct of our lads&mdash;&#8203;for they had scarcely become men&mdash;&#8203;became
so reckless that military discipline had to be rigidly
enforced, while in many instances severe or fatal illness seemed to be
the direct result of their own misconduct. As a ready, and as thought
at the time effectual, means of coercion, corporal punishment was
awarded by courts-martial. The ordeal of being present during its
infliction was nauseating; but constituted as the detachment was, the
punishment seemed to have been in all cases well deserved.</p>

<p>General Raper was the officer in political charge of the Nawab of
Moorshedabad, then a boy of some ten years old. Several civilians
high in rank, and a few non-official residents, for the most part connected
with the manufacture of <span class="locked">tussar<a name="FNanchor_14" id="FNanchor_14" href="#Footnote_14" class="fnanchor">14</a></span> silk, resided at Berhampore.
From several of them we young officers received much attention and
kindness, not only in their own houses but on excursions organized
by them for our special benefit. Prominent among those who thus
befriended us, young “griffs” as we were, General Raper and Charles
Du Pré Russell are remembered gratefully&mdash;&#8203;even while these notes are
penned, many years after the date and incidents referred to.</p>

<p>In due time the order arrived for us to resume our river journey,
our destination Cawnpore; again country-made boats our means of
transport. In the early days of August we started on what was to be
in many respects a monotonous voyage, though not altogether without
its excitement and stirring incidents. The general manner of our<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_15" id="Page_15">15</a></span>
progress was that with which we were now acquainted. We were
doomed, as before, to be at intervals stricken by cholera, which
seemed to have its favourite lurking-places, generally at the foot of
a somewhat precipitous alluvial bank. Night after night rest was
disturbed or altogether banished by the sound of tom-toms, songs,
barking of dogs, cries of jackals; sight and smell offended by
funeral fires as they blazed in near proximity to us.</p>

<p>More than half our journey was got over without special mishap.
Our boatmen observe that signs of coming storm appear in the sky;
they prepare as best they can, but soon the hurricane is upon us.
Boats are dashed against each other, and against the river bank;
waves break over them, tearing away their flimsy gear, battering
some to pieces, their inmates obliged to escape and save themselves
as best they could. After a time there came a downpour
of rain; then gradually the storm ceased, leaving several of our
number boatless, and destitute of greater or smaller portions of our
respective kits. Among others, I suffered considerably. A friend in
need, more fortunate than myself, gave me hospitality on his boat until
sometime thereafter, when, with others similarly situated, I chartered a
budgerow. A few days after our mishap news reached us that a similar
fleet to our own, with <span class="locked">troops,<a name="FNanchor_15" id="FNanchor_15" href="#Footnote_15" class="fnanchor">15</a></span> some thirty miles ahead of us, suffered
very severely from the same hurricane that had struck us, a considerable
number of the men in it having perished in the river.</p>

<p>Without further incident of importance we arrived at Cawnpore in the
early days of November, our journey by river having occupied more than
two months and a half, the date fourteen years before the terrible year
1857, when that station was to acquire the sad memory ever since associated
with it. Anticipating the return to India of the force commanded
by General Pollock from Jellalabad, the march to which place had
restored British prestige from the temporary eclipse at Jugdulluck,
orders were issued to honour that army by an appropriate military display
on the left bank of the Sutlej. Among the regiments assembled
for that purpose, at Ferozepore, the then frontier station, were the Buffs.
Orders had also directed that on completion of that duty they should
march towards Allahabad and there occupy the fort, the detachment
with which I was connected joining headquarters <i>en route</i>. For the
time being we were attached to the 50th Regiment, and so continued
during the remaining four months of the cold season.</p>

<p>Here took place the first initiation into their several duties connected<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_16" id="Page_16">16</a></span>
with regimental life of the young men belonging to our detachment,
myself among them. Among the officers in the “Dirty Half-Hundred”
who had served with it during the Peninsular War, when, on
account of the continuous severe work performed by it, the corps
obtained its honourable soubriquet, <span class="locked">three<a name="FNanchor_16" id="FNanchor_16" href="#Footnote_16" class="fnanchor">16</a></span> remained, looked up to
with the respect due to, and then accorded to, distinguished veterans.
Alternate with duties assigned to us, amusements filled up our time
pleasantly. Gaiety was in full flow. Many were the joyous gatherings
by which were filled the Assembly rooms&mdash;&#8203;some years thereafter to be
the scene of very terrible doings. Outdoor games and sports were the
order of the day, the tract of jungle in Oude that stretched along the
opposite river bank proving our most happy hunting ground. So it
was that time passed pleasantly, if in an intellectual sense not very
profitably. At the time alluded to traffic and communication with
Oude was by means of a long bridge of boats, that bridge from their
attack on which in subsequent days the Gwalior mutineers were to be
driven by the forces under Sir Colin <span class="locked">Campbell.<a name="FNanchor_17" id="FNanchor_17" href="#Footnote_17" class="fnanchor">17</a></span></p>

<p>A large force, comprising all arms, then occupied that important
station. The impression made upon us, as for the first time we beheld
the magnificent spectacle presented by general field-day parades and
exercises, was never to be forgotten. The swarthy visages of the sepoys;
their quaint uniforms attracted our notice. The solidarity of the 50th
gave the impression of irresistible force. The rush of cavalry, as, like a
whirlwind, they went at full charge, to a great extent concealed in a
cloud of dust raised by their horses’ hoofs; the magnificent and unsurpassed
Bengal Horse Artillery, in performing the evolutions pertaining
to them,&mdash;&#8203;these incidents struck us with amazement and admiration.
Little did we think that not many months thereafter we were to be even
more struck with admiration at the brilliant performance of some of
those very troops in actual fight.</p>

<p>A trip to <span class="locked">Agra<a name="FNanchor_18" id="FNanchor_18" href="#Footnote_18" class="fnanchor">18</a></span> introduced me to the experiences of <i>palkee
dâk</i>. Travelling by night, the distance got over was about fifty miles;
alongside trotted torch-carriers, the odours from those “pillars of
flame” foul and offensive. During the day a halt was made at bungalows
provided by Government for the use of travellers. Thus were
four days occupied in making a journey of two hundred miles. In
and near Agra various excursions were made and places of interest
visited. In the fort had recently been deposited the gates of Somnath,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_17" id="Page_17">17</a></span><a name="FNanchor_19" id="FNanchor_19" href="#Footnote_19" class="fnanchor">19</a>
in connection with the removal of which from Ghuznee the bombastic
proclamation by Lord Ellenborough was still subject of comment. The
tomb of <span class="locked">Akbar<a name="FNanchor_20" id="FNanchor_20" href="#Footnote_20" class="fnanchor">20</a></span> and the exquisite Taj <span class="locked">Mahal<a name="FNanchor_21" id="FNanchor_21" href="#Footnote_21" class="fnanchor">21</a></span> were visited on several
occasions. The scene presented by the latter, more especially as seen
by moonlight, was extremely beautiful. The minarets and domes of the
mausoleum, consisting of pure white marble; the long avenue of cypress
trees by which it is approached; the fountains in full play; the ornamental
flower pots,&mdash;&#8203;made upon us an impression never afterwards to
be forgotten.</p>

<p>With the regiments returned recently from Kandahar, aided by troops
from Bombay and Bengal, Sir Charles Napier undertook an expedition
against the disaffected Ameers of Scinde. In February, 1843, the
battles of Meeanee and Hyderabad ended in defeat of their forces,
Hyderabad occupied, the country being conquered during the succeeding
month of March. Of that war it was said: “The Muhamadan
rulers of Sind, known as the Ameers, whose chief fault was that they
would not surrender their independence, were crushed.”</p>

<p>In the neighbouring State of Gwalior events were in progress, the
issue of which was destined to affect the 39th, the 50th, and the Buffs
in a way not at the moment anticipated by either of those regiments.
Early in February, the distant boom of heavy guns intimated to
us at Agra that the Maharajah of Gwalior was dead, and had been
succeeded on his throne by his adopted <span class="locked">son<a name="FNanchor_22" id="FNanchor_22" href="#Footnote_22" class="fnanchor">22</a></span> in the absence of a lineal
heir. In such events there did not appear anything to interfere with
the routine of pleasure in which so many young officers indulged;
that routine went on uninterruptedly, for as yet with them the serious
business of life was in the future.</p>

<p>Those were indeed the days of India’s hospitality, alike in respect to
individuals and regiments. For example: Three weeks had I been an
honorary member of the “Dorsets’” mess, when the time of my
departure arrived; yet to my request for my mess bill I received the
reply, “There is none.” Among the officers whose hospitality I had
so long unconsciously enjoyed were two, father and son, both of whom
I was shortly to meet under circumstances very different from those in
which I had made their acquaintance.</p>

<p class="drop-cap3"><span class="smcap1">Eighteen</span> months had elapsed since the day when we left Chatham
to that on which we joined the distinguished <span class="locked">regiment<a name="FNanchor_23" id="FNanchor_23" href="#Footnote_23" class="fnanchor">23</a></span> of
which I was a member, the manner of my reception kind and friendly.
As the regiment passed through Cawnpore, a short halt was ordered to
take place; the camp to be pitched on that part of the parade ground,
afterwards to be occupied by the defences in connection with which
the story of General Wheeler and his party has left so many sad
associations. The object of that halt appeared in Division Orders&mdash;&#8203;the
carrying into execution of sentence of death passed by General
Court-Martial on a soldier of the regiment convicted of murdering a
comrade. This was to be the first regimental parade on which I was to
appear. By sunrise the troops were in their places, so as to form three
sides of a square, the fourth being partly occupied by the construction
above which the fatal beam and its supports stood prominent. The
procession of death began its march, the regimental band wailing forth
the Dead March; then came the coffin, carried by low-caste natives;
then the condemned man, ghastly pale, strongly guarded. Thus did
they proceed until they arrived at the place of execution. The eyes of
most of us were averted, and so we saw not the further details of the
sad drama. Regiment after regiment marched past the structure,
from which dangled the body of a man; thence to their respective
barracks or tents, their bands playing “rollicking” tunes.</p>

<p>Pleasant as novel were the incidents of our march eastward along
that most excellent highway, the Grand Trunk Road. The early rouse,
“striking” tents, the “fall in,” the start while as yet stars glistened in
the sky and dawn had not appeared; then came the wild note
of the <span class="locked">coel<a name="FNanchor_24" id="FNanchor_24" href="#Footnote_24" class="fnanchor">24</a></span> as herald of coming day; the gleam of blazing fire
far ahead, indicating where the midway halt was to take place, and<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_19" id="Page_19">19</a></span>
morning coffee with biscuits was in readiness for all. Resuming the
day’s journey, we reached the appointed camp ground by 8 a.m. Tents
were quickly pitched on lines previously drawn by the Quarter-master
and his staff. Bath, a hearty breakfast, duty, shooting, and other
excursions occupied the day, then early dinner, early to bed, and so
ready to undergo similar routine on the morrow. In our progress we
passed through Futtehpore, a place to be subsequently the scene of
stubborn fight against mutineers in 1857.</p>

<p>Attached to the Buffs were the remnants of what had been the
44th Regiment, now consisting of a few men of whom the majority
were mutilated or suffering from bodily illness; the party under command
of Captain Souter, by whose gallant devotion to duty the
regimental colour was saved two years previous when our force was
annihilated near the Khyber by Affghans, directed by Akbar Khan.</p>

<p>Pârâg, as the locality of Allahabad was anciently called, is closely
connected with Hindoo tradition, and still retains a sacred character.
At the date referred to in the Ramayana it was a residence of a Rajah
of “the powerful Kosalas,” whose capital was Ajudyia, their country
the modern Oude. Here it was that Rama and Seeta crossed the
Ganges in their progress to the jungles of Dandaka, where shortly afterwards
she was captured by Ravana and carried away by him to Lunka,
otherwise Ceylon. Within the fort, now occupied by our regiment, is
an underground temple dedicated to Siva, its position believed to indicate
the point where the mythical Suruswatee joins the still sacred
Ganges. On an enclosed piece of ground stands one of six pillars
assigned to Asoka, <span class="smcap smaller">B.C.</span> 240, bearing an inscription of the period of
Samudra Gupta, 2nd century <span class="smcap smaller">A.D.</span> That pillar, having fallen, was
restored by Jehangir, <span class="smcap smaller">A.D.</span> 1605; the fort itself captured by the English
from Shah Alum, <span class="smcap smaller">A.D.</span> 1765.</p>

<p>As the hot season advanced, severe and fatal disease prevailed alarmingly
among our men, cholera and heat fever claiming victims after a
few hours’ illness. Treatment applied by the younger medical officers
in accordance with theoretical school teaching was useless, nor was it
till the regimental surgeon (Dr. Macqueen) directed us to more
practical methods that anything approaching favourable results were attained.
In these notes, however, the intention is to omit professional
matters.</p>

<p>A full company of our men was sent to Papamow, situated on the right
bank of the Ganges, six miles distant, the object being to afford additional
space to those within the fort. Captain Airey, in command of the
detachment, had been one of the hostages in Affghanistan to Akbar
Khan, and utilised on that occasion his culinary talents by acting as<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_20" id="Page_20">20</a></span>
cook to the party. For a time the men enjoyed, and benefited by their
change to country quarters. Towards the end of the rainy season,
however, malarial diseases attacked them to a degree larger in proportion
than their comrades in the fort; consequently our detachment was
ordered to rejoin Headquarters.</p>

<p>A good deal of freedom was allowed to the soldiers when first sent
to the country place above mentioned, one result being that crime was
next to absent from among them. A favourite amusement was shooting
in the adjoining woods and fields, and, unhappily for some of them, of
bathing, notwithstanding strict orders to the contrary, in the Ganges,
then in full flood. On one of those shooting excursions a soldier got
bitten in the hand by a cobra, the reptile being immediately killed, and
brought in with him. That the teeth penetrated was manifest by the
wounds; yet, strange to say, no serious results followed&mdash;&#8203;a circumstance
accounted for only by supposing that the poison sacs must by some
means have been emptied immediately previous. Of those who insisted
on entering the river, some fell victims to their temerity.</p>

<p>The pursuit and study of subjects relative to natural history
furnished those of us whose leanings were in those directions with continuous
enjoyment and profitable occupation. Visits by friends and
small attempts at hospitality came in as so many pleasant interludes.
When neither of these was practicable, a good supply of books and
papers gave us variety in the way of reading.</p>

<p>So time passed until the month of September, when the cultivated
fields were covered by heavy crops special to this part of India. A
sudden outburst of discordant noises induces us to quit our quarters in
search of the wherefore. A dense cloud is seen in rapid advance from
the south-east; myriads of locusts, for of those insects it is composed,
alight upon and by their accumulated weight bear down the stems
to which they cling. Next day a similar flight is upon us, devouring
every green thing; eight days thereafter, a third, but it passed over
the locality, obscuring the sky as it did so.</p>

<p>The regimental mess house occupied an elevated position adjoining
and overlooking the Jumna, a short distance above the confluence of
that river with the Ganges, a terrace pertaining to the building being a
favourite resort whereon, in the cool of the evening, it was usual for the
officers to enjoy the refreshing breeze, when there was any, and contemplate
the unrippled surface of the deep stream as it glided past.
On one such evening, while a number of us were so enjoying the
scene, watching the lights of native boats secured for the night to either
bank, and listening to that strange mixture of sounds to which natives
give the name of music, a series of what appeared to be floating lamps<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_21" id="Page_21">21</a></span>
emerged from where the boats lay thickest and glided along the stream.
Here we witnessed the scene alluded to, and so graphically described
by <span class="locked">L.E.L.<a name="FNanchor_25" id="FNanchor_25" href="#Footnote_25" class="fnanchor">25</a></span> in her version of “The Hindoo Girl’s <span class="locked">Song.”<a name="FNanchor_26" id="FNanchor_26" href="#Footnote_26" class="fnanchor">26</a></span> It was, in
fact, the Dewalee <span class="locked">Festival.<a name="FNanchor_27" id="FNanchor_27" href="#Footnote_27" class="fnanchor">27</a></span></p>

<p>Allahabad was the chief civil station in the provinces; the principal
courts were situated there, the higher officials connected with criminal
and with revenue administration having their residences scattered over
what was an extensive and ornamental settlement. Some of their
houses were noted for hospitality, and for more homely entertainments
given for the special benefit of the younger officers. Of the latter, that
of Mrs. <span class="locked">Tayler<a name="FNanchor_28" id="FNanchor_28" href="#Footnote_28" class="fnanchor">28</a></span> has left most pleasant recollections, the good influence
exerted by that lady making its mark on some of us who might otherwise
have had remembrances very different in kind. Among the most
esteemed of the residents was Dr. Angus, “The Good Samaritan,” as
he was called. Hospitable to all; considerate to juniors; his good
advice, and help in other ways, readily given to all who in difficulties
applied to him.</p>

<p>Early in October, the Commander-in-Chief, Sir Hugh Gough, arrived
<i>en route</i> north-westward. New colours were presented by His Excellency
to a native <span class="locked">regiment<a name="FNanchor_29" id="FNanchor_29" href="#Footnote_29" class="fnanchor">29</a></span> of distinguished service in Affghanistan,
the event celebrated by festive gatherings, in accordance with customary<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_22" id="Page_22">22</a></span>
usage. On the staff of His Excellency were two officers, both
of whom subsequently attained high military distinction; the one Sir
Harry Smith, the other Sir Patrick Grant.</p>

<p>Reports were “in the air” that a Camp of Exercise was about to
assemble at Agra, as an experiment then tried in India for the first
time. Bazaar report had it that the Buffs were about to be ordered on
service, the scene and nature of which did not just then transpire.
Meanwhile, responsible officers “saw to” the state of “brown Bess,”
with which weapon our men were then armed; to that of ammunition,
and other necessary items of equipment. The arrival of part of the 29th
Regiment, to take our place, next followed, and, simultaneously, came
an order directing the Buffs to proceed to Kalpee, on the Jumna,
thirteen days’ march distant. A few days thereafter, published orders
directed the organization of “the Army of Exercise” into divisions
and brigades; still, there was no inkling of what was about to
happen.</p>

<p>For some time previous evidences were manifest that all was not
right in Gwalior; latterly report said that things in that State had
settled down, terms having been come to between the young Maharajah
and leaders of the disaffected. A few days thereafter, our preparations
were renewed; our weakly men, together with soldiers’ wives and
children, arranged for to be left behind, and with a fighting strength of
739 powerful and seasoned soldiers, the regiment started fit and ready
for whatever service might be required of it.</p>

<p>The actual state of affairs, above referred to, was briefly this:&mdash;&#8203;The
young Maharajah, known as “Ali Jah Jyajee Scindia,” owed his
selection to the widow of the deceased monarch of the same name,
who died childless, she a girl aged thirteen, named Tara Bye. To
the post of Regent, Mama Sahib, an uncle of the deceased monarch,
was acknowledged by Lord Ellenborough through the Resident,
against the wishes of the Maharanee; Dada Khasjee, steward of the
Household, by the Maharanee. Thereupon, the Resident was ordered
by His Excellency to quit Gwalior, and the Dada prepared his troops
to oppose forces of the Company, if sent against him; hence the campaign
now about to take place.</p>

<p>In the Punjab, conditions were at the same time most serious, giving
rise to expectations of armed intervention there. For example:&mdash;&#8203;On
the 15th of September, 1843, was perpetrated the double murder of the
Maharajah Shere <span class="locked">Singh<a name="FNanchor_30" id="FNanchor_30" href="#Footnote_30" class="fnanchor">30</a></span> and his son Pertab, at the northern gate of
Lahore, the conspiracy which led up to that deed having been formed<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_23" id="Page_23">23</a></span>
by Dyhan <span class="locked">Singh.<a name="FNanchor_31" id="FNanchor_31" href="#Footnote_31" class="fnanchor">31</a></span> Next day Ajeet Singh, by whose hand the crime
was committed, together with his followers, were attacked and put to
death by Heera Singh, son of the deceased vizier, and his party. For
a time a state of anarchy, with its attendant slaughter and rapine,
prevailed within the capital. These having run their course,
Dhuleep Singh, only surviving son of Runjeet, was placed upon the
throne of his father, Heera Singh making himself vizier. Meanwhile,
the Sikh or Khalasa army had become formidable under Lal Singh, a
favourite of the <span class="locked">Ranee;<a name="FNanchor_32" id="FNanchor_32" href="#Footnote_32" class="fnanchor">32</a></span> as an outcome of a conspiracy among them,
Heera was murdered, his place taken by <span class="locked">Lal.<a name="FNanchor_33" id="FNanchor_33" href="#Footnote_33" class="fnanchor">33</a></span> Nothing could then
restrain their ardour but an expedition into British territory, for which
it was well understood that preparations were in progress. The
proceedings thus alluded to supplied ample subject for comment in the
papers, and talk at social gatherings.</p>

in Punjab&mdash;&#8203;Rejoin the Buffs.</p></blockquote>

<p class="drop-cap3"><span class="smcap1">On</span> the day the Buffs began their march, I proceeded to join
the 16th Lancers, to which distinguished regiment I had
been, by General Orders, attached for duty. Ten nights were passed
in travelling by palkee dâk. In early morning of the eleventh day
the Kutub was seen in bold relief against the indistinct horizon, for
the atmosphere was laden with dust. After a little time, the Jumna
was crossed by a bridge of boats; then another interval, and I was
hospitably received by Dr. Ross, to whom I had an introduction.</p>

<p>Various places of interest in the imperial city were visited in turn.
The Jumna Musjid, or chief mosque, its domes and minarets imposing
in their grandeur; the balcony in the Chandee Chouk, whereon, in 1739,
Nadir Shah sat witnessing the massacre of the inhabitants; the palace
of the once “Great Mogul”; the smaller building in its garden, within
which had stood “the Peacock Throne”; the remnants of the
crystal seat upon which, in ancient times, monarchs were crowned;
those of numerous fountains; the Persian inscription, to the effect
that “If there is an Elysium upon earth, it is this.” But from the
ruins around, frogs and lizards stared at us; the once gorgeous
palaces, and all that pertained to them, were smeared over with filth.</p>

<p>At a distance of twelve miles from the city stands the Kutub, surrounded
by numerous remains of buildings, the road through all that
way being along a space covered by ruins of various kinds. The
Cashmere gate of Delhi by which we emerged was then noted as the
place where Mr. Fraser, Resident at the Court of the Emperor, was
murdered, and where Shumshoodeen, the instigator of that crime, was<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_25" id="Page_25">25</a></span>
executed; it was to become famous as the scene of severe but victorious
struggle against the mutineers in 1857. About two miles onwards
stood the ruins of an astronomical observatory, one of two of
their kind in India, the other being at Benares. A little farther on was
the tomb of Sufter Jung, minister to the princes of Delhi; then continuous
ranges of ruins until we arrive at Feroze’s Lath, a metal pillar,
the history of which is somewhat obscure, but on which marks of shot
indicate attempts by Nadir Shah to destroy it. Now we reach the
Kutub, a pillar sixty-five yards in circumference at the base, the ascent
within it comprising three hundred and twenty-nine steps, the exterior
interrupted by four terraces. Legend relates that it is Hindoo in
origin; history that its exterior ornamentation was seriously damaged
by the Mahomedan conquerors. Not far from it are the ruins of what
would seem to have been a tower of still larger dimensions. In the
vicinity of the latter a deep well, into which from a height of sixty feet
natives dived, performing strange evolutions in mid-air as they did so.</p>

<p>From Delhi to Muttra the journey was made along by-paths across
country. In camp near the latter-named city were the 16th, commanded
by Colonel Cureton, and there I joined them. The fact had
meantime been promulgated that the destination of “the Army of
Exercise” was to be Gwalior. The force so named, 30,000 strong, was
to be divided into two wings or corps, to enter that State simultaneously
from two directions. That from the south and eastward comprised
the Buffs, 50th Regiment, 9th Lancers, Artillery, Native Cavalry, and
Native Infantry; that from the west, the 16th Lancers, 39th and 40th
Regiments, a strong force of Artillery, 1st and 10th Regiments of Native
Cavalry, 4th Irregulars, and several regiments of Native Infantry.</p>

<p>While arrangements for active movements were being matured, those
of us on whom as yet cares of office had not descended, passed our
time in visiting places of interest in and near the cities of Muttra and
Bindrabund, both held sacred by Hindoos in relation to the life of
Krishna. In the last-named city we were only permitted to approach
the principal temple that stood close to its entrance gate, but from the
distance we could see, stretching far away as it seemed to us, the
vista of its interior, dimly lighted by hanging lamps; at its extreme
end the emblem of the deity to whom it was dedicated, resplendent
with gems and precious stones. Everywhere along the narrow streets
and from the flat roofs of their houses armies of “sacred” baboons
grinned and chattered at us. A picnic to some characteristically Indian
<span class="locked">gardens<a name="FNanchor_34" id="FNanchor_34" href="#Footnote_34" class="fnanchor">34</a></span> adjoining the banks of the Jumna furnished us with another
pleasant interlude.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_26" id="Page_26">26</a></span>
The division of the force of which the 16th were part resumed its
march; in three days arrived at its assigned position not far from Agra
and there encamped, pending the result of an ultimatum dispatched
by the Governor-General to the disaffected Gwalior leaders. Meanwhile,
arrivals of the high civil and military officials, additions to the
force, salutes and festivities afforded all of us pleasant occupation and
variety.</p>

<p>The answer of the chiefs arrives; its terms are defiant. War against
the State immediately <span class="locked">proclaimed<a name="FNanchor_35" id="FNanchor_35" href="#Footnote_35" class="fnanchor">35</a></span> by Lord Ellenborough; portions of
the force put in motion towards the river Chumbul, among them the
16th. The appointed rendezvous near Dholpore is speedily reached,
and there we encamp.</p>

<p>A vakeel arrives in camp, bearer of a dispatch by which the leaders
of Gwalior rebels submit proposals for peace, on their own terms.
They are at once refused. By daybreak next morning the force is in
motion. Three hours suffice for crossing the Chumbul, an operation
effected without important incident; establishments follow without delay;
camp is pitched on hostile territory. The aspect of our position
and immediate vicinity presents uneven ground, intersected by deep
ravines, destitute of roadways. Our halt is of short duration. Early
next morning the force emerged on open country; in due time arrived
in near proximity to the village of Sehoree, and there encamped.</p>

<p>Meanwhile, information was received that Gwalior forces were rapidly
concentrating in our front. Officers on the staff of our Quartermaster-General
reconnoitred the country to a radius of ten miles and more
around our camp. Soon the <span class="locked">“Chief”<a name="FNanchor_36" id="FNanchor_36" href="#Footnote_36" class="fnanchor">36</a></span> issued orders that the march
should be resumed next day, and the Mahrattas attacked if met with.</p>

<p>Conversation at mess turned upon the probable events so soon to
transpire; extemporised plans by individual officers indicated the
several views they entertained of what was to happen. The very young
expressed hopes that the enemy would show good fight; some of their
number speculated on the chances of promotion before them. Then
broke in one of the seniors, who had gained experience of war in
Affghanistan: “I have just been employed in making a few little arrangements
in case of accidents.” “Highly proper,” remarked another
“for no one knows what to-morrow may bring forth.”</p>

<p>At daylight on December 29 our force began its advance, its
manner of distribution to make an attack simultaneously on front and
flank of the position known to have been occupied by the Mahrattas<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_27" id="Page_27">27</a></span>
the previous evening. But during the night they had taken up a new
position, considerably in advance, and from it unexpectedly opened fire
on our leading columns. The general force was at once directed upon
the new position. Horse Artillery commanded by Captain <span class="locked">Grant<a name="FNanchor_37" id="FNanchor_37" href="#Footnote_37" class="fnanchor">37</a></span> at
full gallop rode directly at the Gwalior battery; opened fire upon it
with crushing effect, and within the space of a few minutes reduced it
to silence. Having done so, away again at full gallop Captain Grant
led his battery against one on the left of the former, that had meanwhile
opened upon us, our infantry columns plodding their way,
slowly but steadily, against its line of fire. Very soon that battery also
was silenced. The infantry were at work with the bayonet with terrible
effect upon the enemy, with very heavy loss to our own forces, in men,
horses, and ammunition. A third battery began its deadly work upon
other bodies of infantry, in motion onwards. Again Captain Grant led
his troop against it with the same result; then arrived the infantry,
including the 39th and 40th British regiments; then hand-to-hand
conflict, and then&mdash;&#8203;the positions were in the grasp of our forces.</p>

<p>While thus the conflict raged fiercely, the 16th, led by Colonel
Rowland <span class="locked">Smyth,<a name="FNanchor_38" id="FNanchor_38" href="#Footnote_38" class="fnanchor">38</a></span> together with the two cavalry <span class="locked">regiments<a name="FNanchor_39" id="FNanchor_39" href="#Footnote_39" class="fnanchor">39</a></span> brigaded
with them, were ordered to sweep round the rebel camp, cut off, destroy,
or disperse those who, driven from their guns, might take to flight.
The Lancers dashed onwards at the charge, the bright steel and showy
pennants of their weapons seeming to skim the ground, while at intervals
stray rebels fell lifeless. The Gwalior men, anticipating such a manœuvre,
had taken precautions against its complete success; the position for
heaviest guns selected by them had along its front a ravine of great
breadth and depth. Upon its edge the cavalry suddenly came, nor is it
clear by what means they escaped being precipitated into it. There
was for a moment some confusion as the halt was sounded; eighteen
guns directly in front, six others in flank sent their missiles through
our ranks or high above them. To remain exposed to risks of more
perfect practice would serve no good purpose; there was no alternative
but to retire. The infantry were seen advancing; down one side of
the ravine, lost to sight; up the further side, then onwards, into the
batteries, and then&mdash;&#8203;the fight was won.</p>

<p>When at first the 16th took the position assigned to them on the field,
it may have been that my endeavours to discover what was subsequently
called “the first line of assistance” were unsuccessful; it may have been<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_28" id="Page_28">28</a></span>
that they were not very keenly made, at any rate “the Brigadier”&mdash;&#8203;for
so was named the troop horse I rode&mdash;&#8203;knew his right place in the
ranks, and so enabled me to witness the events now described.</p>

<p>Returning to my proper duties, I joined the parties who traversed
the field of battle in search of wounded. Great, alas! was the number
who lay prostrate,&mdash;&#8203;many dead, many more suffering from wounds.
Among the latter was General Churchill, his injuries of a nature to
make him aware that speedy death was inevitable. While being attended
to with all possible care, he requested me to take charge of the valuable
watch he wore, and after his demise to send it to his son-in-law,
Captain <span class="locked">Mitchell<a name="FNanchor_40" id="FNanchor_40" href="#Footnote_40" class="fnanchor">40</a></span> of the 6th Foot, at that time serving in South Africa.
During the night he died, and his request was carried out by me.</p>

<p>At a short distance lay, in the growing crop that covered the field of
battle, Lieutenant Cavanagh of the 4th Irregulars, loudly calling to
attract attention, supporting by his hands a limb from which dangled
the foot and part of the leg, his other limb grazed by a round shot
which inflicted both wounds, and passed through his horse, now lying
dead beside him. He was taken to the hospital tents, where meanwhile
wounded soldiers and officers in considerable numbers had accumulated.
The surgeons’ work begun, <span class="locked">three<a name="FNanchor_41" id="FNanchor_41" href="#Footnote_41" class="fnanchor">41</a></span> of us mutually assisted
each other. The turn of Lieutenant Cavanagh to be attended to
having come, he made a request that we should “just wait a bit while
he wrote to his wife,” for he had recently been married. This done,
he submitted to amputation, and during that process uttered no cry or
groan, though nothing in the shape of anæsthetic was given, nor had
chloroform as such been discovered; then, during the interval purposely
permitted to elapse between the operation and final dressing,
he continued his letter to his young wife, these circumstances illustrating
the courage and endurance so characteristic among men (and women)
at the time referred to. His case was one of many men who had to be
succoured that day.</p>

<p>Meanwhile the force was in process of encamping on the field so
gallantly won; the 16th paraded for roll call, the band of the regiment
playing “The Convent Bells,” the notes of which long years thereafter
recalled the day and occasion. <span class="locked">Casualties<a name="FNanchor_42" id="FNanchor_42" href="#Footnote_42" class="fnanchor">42</a></span> among the men were only<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_29" id="Page_29">29</a></span>
nine; but among the horses more numerous than they had been at
Waterloo, where as Light Dragoons the 16th so highly distinguished
<span class="locked">themselves.<a name="FNanchor_43" id="FNanchor_43" href="#Footnote_43" class="fnanchor">43</a></span></p>

<p>The arduous and responsible work of the day over, those of us who
could do so withdrew to our tents, our hearts full of gratitude to the
Almighty for individual safety, there to obtain such measure of rest
and quiet as under the circumstances was procurable; for all through
the evening and early hours of night the bright glare from burning
villages, the dense smoke from others, the dull heavy sound of
exploding mines made the hours hideous. Such was the battle of
“Maharajpore.”</p>

<p>During the evening the mangled remains of what in the morning had
been a band of brave men were committed to earth. With returning
daylight the same sad task was continued, all possible honour being
shown to the dead according to the rank they had held, from that of
General Officer in the person of General Churchill, who had succumbed
in the course of the night, to that of the private soldier. Meantime, in
tents the work of attending to the wounded went steadily on. There,
officers and men whom we personally knew, lay helpless; among them
Major Bray, of the 39th, and his son in adjoining cots, the former
terribly burnt by the explosion of a mine, the life-blood of the latter
ebbing through a bullet-wound in his <span class="locked">chest.<a name="FNanchor_44" id="FNanchor_44" href="#Footnote_44" class="fnanchor">44</a></span> And there were many
other very painful instances, to the aid of whom our best endeavours
had to be directed.</p>

<p>It was for the time being impossible to carry on with the army, in its
further advance, the large number of wounded with which it was now
encumbered. A guard sufficiently strong to protect the extemporised
field hospital having been detailed, the general force resumed its
march, the intention being to press on as rapidly as possible to the
capital. Along a tract of soft sandy country, oppressed by heat, exhausted
by the fatigue of the previous day, the troops plodded their
weary way, in their progress passing many relics of the recent fight,
including shot, arms, shreds of clothing, dead bodies of animals and of
men, etc.</p>

<p>At last the halt resounded from trumpet and bugle; for a time
we rested as best we could, and then the tents having arrived we<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_30" id="Page_30">30</a></span>
encamped. Some further delay was rendered necessary by circumstances.
During that and the succeeding day information was received
in camp that while the battle was proceeding in the vicinity of
Maharajpore, an engagement equally formidable took place between
the Mahrattas and the force under General Grey at Punniar, on the
eastern border of the Gwalior State; that in it the Buffs had sustained
a loss in killed of one officer and thirteen men, in wounded of three
officers and sixty men,&mdash;&#8203;the casualties in the 50th being equally
numerous.</p>

<p>The arrival in camp of the Queen Regent, together with her Sirdars,
and the young Maharajah, the salute on the accession of whom some
ten months previous has been already mentioned, caused no little
excitement, and at the same time much speculation among us.
Later on, however, the report spread that the result of their interview
with the Governor-General was by both parties deemed satisfactory.</p>

<p>As some among us took rides in different directions around our
camp, not an armed man was met with. In some of the villages
visited individuals who had escaped the carnage of the previous day
were found lying more or less completely stripped of clothing, and
wounded, some of them dead. The villagers had fallen upon the
fugitives, robbed them of all they possessed, then turned them adrift.
They had failed, and they paid the penalty of failure.</p>

<p>The march resumed, the force in due time reached the immediate
vicinity of Gwalior, and there encamped. The huge fortress seemed
to tower above us, while the neighbouring hills looked as if from
their summits a well-directed fire could have swept the country to a
considerable distance around. Within a couple of days arrived the
force under General Grey and the Seepree contingent under Brigadier
Stubbs. Negotiations had so far advanced that the latter took
possession of the fort, the camp of the former adding very considerably
to the dimensions of the great canvas city already existing. Rapidly
and completely did the routine of life to which for some time past
we had been accustomed undergo a change: complimentary visits
and entertainments, each regiment entertaining every one else and being
in turn entertained by them. By the high officials durbars and
receptions were held, to which ceremonials Representatives of Gwalior
having given their presence, the fact that they did so indicated that
the end of our expedition was approaching.</p>

<p>Connected with the strong fortress by which the city of Gwalior is
dominated were many points of interest; among them the general aspect
of decay as seen from without, the tortuous narrow lane that leads
to it, the steep and difficult flight of stone steps by which the ascent<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_31" id="Page_31">31</a></span>
must be made, and powerful gates that seemed to lead but to a
mass of ruins. Within the defences we were face to face with
remains of temples, pillars, and arches pertaining to edifices of the
<span class="locked">Jains;<a name="FNanchor_45" id="FNanchor_45" href="#Footnote_45" class="fnanchor">45</a></span> there were remains of what had been reservoirs of large
dimensions and beautiful workmanship, in some portions of which
clear water glistened in the sunlight. Only one piece of ordnance
was met with; it was an ancient gun, seventeen feet in length, and
apparently capable of discharging a fifty-eight pound shot.</p>

<p>The process of disarming the Gwalior troops was next performed&mdash;&#8203;somewhat
slowly at first, and not without some risk of difficulty,
but more rapidly as information circulated among them that they were
to receive all arrears of pay due, and a certain number of them
taken into the service of “the <span class="locked">Company.”<a name="FNanchor_46" id="FNanchor_46" href="#Footnote_46" class="fnanchor">46</a></span> Then did they march
to the places assigned to them in battalions, their bands playing what
was intended to be “God Save the Queen”; finally laying down
their arms and surrendering their colours, all of which, packed on
elephants, were taken to the fort. The artillery and cavalry gave theirs
up elsewhere.</p>

<p>The wounded from different regiments were collected in camp, those
among them fit to undergo the journey towards Allahabad being dispatched
thither by means of doolies and native carts (hackeries),&mdash;&#8203;the
orders of the Commander-in-Chief, as expressed by himself, being that
their progress thither should be by “easy stages and intermediate
halts.” From Allahabad they were to be conveyed by means of native
boats to Calcutta, and there embarked on board one or more of the
most comfortably and well-equipped ships proceeding viâ the Cape to
England. For those whose condition was more serious, accommodation
was provided in camp, and in public buildings outside the city of
Gwalior. Among those so left were three respected officers of the
Buffs. Of these, Captain Chatterton and Dr. Macqueen shortly afterwards
succumbed to the disease&mdash;&#8203;induced by the trials of active service.
The death of the third&mdash;&#8203;namely, Captain Magrath&mdash;&#8203;was attended
by a little circumstance which showed that the spirit of romance persisted
to the last in him. During the battle at Punniar, he, together
with thirteen men of his company, were blown up by the explosion of
a tumbril that they were in the act of capturing. Captain Magrath
and twelve of the soldiers with him speedily succumbed, or were
instantly killed. When his body was being prepared for burial, there,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_32" id="Page_32">32</a></span>
over the region of the heart, was found a lady’s glove; nor was it difficult,
bearing in mind some of the most pleasant incidents at Allahabad
already recorded, to indicate the hand to which the memento originally
pertained.</p>

<p>A general parade of the combined forces now took place. On that
occasion the young Maharajah accompanied the Governor-General, by
whom, in the course of his address, sufficient was expressed to raise
hopes that further service on the Punjab frontier was to be immediately
undertaken. But this was not to be.</p>

<p>Disintegration of “the Army of Exercise” forthwith began, in
obedience to orders issued. Starting on their return march, the 16th
traversed the field on which, twenty-nine days previous, the battle
already mentioned had taken place. At short distances over its extent
lay bodies of men and horses far advanced in decomposition; fragments
of natives and equipments everywhere. The village of Maharajpore
reduced to charred ruins; in their midst numbers of dead bodies of
those who had so manfully stood their ground and perished as they did
so. In what had been a room or enclosure a confused heap of what
had been men further testified to the obstinacy of the defence. In
some places miserable-looking inhabitants were searching among the
ruins for property and houses. Such was the wreck of battle.</p>

<p>Thence to Meerut the march of the Lancers was uneventful. Halts
for a day were made respectively at Hattras and Alighur, associated as
those places are with early campaigns of the century. At the latter fortress
we visited the gate and approach thereto through which was made the
historic charge by the 76th <span class="locked">Regiment;<a name="FNanchor_47" id="FNanchor_47" href="#Footnote_47" class="fnanchor">47</a></span> then the monument to officers
and men who fell on that occasion, and at Laswaree soon thereafter.
Twenty days <i>en route</i>; the 16th re-enter Meerut, whence they had
started on service now happily performed. Very touching were meetings
between wives and their husbands; though to younger and less
thoughtful men the full significance of husband and father restored to
those dependent on him had yet to be realized.</p>

<p>A series of entertainments, including regimental dinners and a station
ball, welcomed the return to cantonments of the 16th and troop of
Horse Artillery, now under Captain Alexander, that had so much distinguished
itself at Maharajpore. Preparations rapidly pushed on for
the annual race for “the Lancer Cup,” and all seemed to settle down
for the hot season of 1844, then fast approaching.</p>

<p>A young (Artillery) officer had the indiscretion to write to the papers
a severe criticism&mdash;&#8203;from his point of view&mdash;&#8203;on the tactics to which,
according to himself, was due the heavy cost in killed and wounded at<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_33" id="Page_33">33</a></span>
which the recent victory had been gained. A second officer made
open boast of the help he had given in preparing that letter, and
both of them boasted pretentiously of what they had done. But soon
the attention of the “authorities,” including the venerable Commander-in-Chief,
was drawn to the comments in question, with the result to the
subalterns concerned that, as expressed at the time, they were “come
down upon like a sledge-hammer.” Popular verdict declared that the
example set by them, if followed, would destroy all discipline.</p>

<p>The date on which, according to ancient custom, the great Hindoo
religious festival of the year was to be held at Hurdwar was near at
hand. As on similar occasions, arrangements were made to send to that
place a small body of native troops, those detailed for the purpose
being men of the 53rd N.I. and 10th Cavalry, I placed in departmental
charge. Our march thither began in the middle of March. As we
proceeded, we went along through a highly cultivated country, many of
the fields covered with “golden grain,” for it was the season of barley
harvest. More and more distinct became the snowy peaks and precipices
of the Himalayahs; denser and more dense the masses of pilgrims
toiling their weary way to the sacred shrine, for the occasion was that
of the greater fair known as Kumbh Mela, held every twelfth <span class="locked">year.<a name="FNanchor_48" id="FNanchor_48" href="#Footnote_48" class="fnanchor">48</a></span></p>

<p>Situated directly on the right bank of the Ganges, where that river
emerges from the Himalayahs, the surroundings of Hurdwar are extremely
beautiful, comprising hill, valley, forest, and stream. At short
intervals temples stand; ghats or steps that lead downward to the
sacred stream are crowded with devotees. In the clear, rapid stream,
men, women, children, and fish commingle&mdash;&#8203;for, like the river, the fish
are sacred. The hills immediately behind the town are of the Sewalik
range. Along their face occur a series of what were roads, though now
scarcely deserving the name; on either side of them are veritable rock
dwellings, now occupied by Fakeers. To the geologist the same range
has interest connected with the remains of extinct animals contained
therein; among them, of Ganesa’s elephant, that lived, died, and
became imbedded in marshes subsequently to be upheaved and so
form the range referred to.</p>

<p>On this <span class="locked">occasion<a name="FNanchor_49" id="FNanchor_49" href="#Footnote_49" class="fnanchor">49</a></span> an estimated number of two hundred thousand
persons were assembled on and in the immediate neighbourhood of the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_34" id="Page_34">34</a></span>
ghats to take part in what was called “the great celebration.” At a
given signal by the Brahmin priests, the masses precipitated themselves
into the river, there to perform their religious ceremonies. Of the
number who did so, about fifteen thousand were women; but it was
said that during some previous years female devotees had been fewer
than heretofore. After nightfall the river was illuminated by floating
lamps as already described in reference to the Jumna at Allahabad,
the scene presented being, as on that occasion, very beautiful.</p>

<p>An excursion to a distance of twenty miles or so up the valley of the
Dhoon, undertaken for the combined purposes of shooting small game
and relaxation, introduced us to surroundings very beautiful in themselves,
full also of living things, animal and vegetable, most interesting
to lovers of Nature. From the point reached by us a striking view
was obtained of the ranges on which stand respectively the sanatoria
of Landour and Mussoorie, and in the further distance snow-covered
peaks of the Himalayahs.</p>

<p>The <i>mela</i> or festival, over, without mishap or outbreak of special
sickness, our return march took place. The mid-day heat had become
great; we were therefore glad to be again within comfortable houses
at Meerut, provided with thermantadotes and <span class="locked">tatties;<a name="FNanchor_50" id="FNanchor_50" href="#Footnote_50" class="fnanchor">50</a></span> and so the
temperature reduced from 105° F. in the open to 76° F. indoors.</p>

<p>Not long thereafter the greater number, if indeed not all of us, were
gratified on reading, in Government Orders, the announcement that
officers and men who had been present at the battles of Meeanee
or Hyderabad, recently fought in Scinde, Punniar, or Maharajpore in
Gwalior, were granted as a donation one years’ batta, amounting in my
instance, with relative rank of lieutenant, to Rs.700&mdash;&#8203;a very welcome
windfall.</p>

<p>Certain native regiments were at this time ordered to the first-named
country. Rumour spread that peace having been established
therein, the extra allowances granted to troops while war was in
progress was to be discontinued. In the regiments alluded to insubordination
immediately showed itself, in at least one of them
to a degree bordering on mutiny. A general parade was ordered; the
disaffected corps so placed as to be in face of artillery, on either side
cavalry and infantry; thereupon the sepoys belonging to it laid down
their arms, after which they were paid up to date and escorted out of
the station. The officer commanding another corps took upon himself
to get rid of the ringleaders without waiting for official authority for so
doing. Thus was suppressed what for the moment threatened to<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_35" id="Page_35">35</a></span>
become a somewhat difficult state of matters. This was in 1844. The
terrible events of 1857 at the same station were in the future.</p>

<p>The state of unrest with reference to affairs in the Punjab continued
to increase, the likelihood of war next cold season appearing the
greater from the facts that military stores were ordered to be collected
at Umballah and Ferozepore, means of transport arranged for, and
troops of various arms warned to proceed towards the frontier. Meanwhile,
Lord Ellenborough was recalled, and Lord Hardinge reigned
as Governor-General in his stead.</p>

<p>At the end of April, in obedience to orders, I started away to rejoin
the Buffs, who had returned to Allahabad. The first part of the
journey thither was performed by horse transit, then recently introduced&mdash;&#8203;the
palanquin placed upon a four-wheeled truck or cart,
drawn by a single horse at the rate of seven miles per hour; for as yet
railways had not been introduced into India. The latter part of
the journey was by ordinary “palkee dâk”; and so, in due course,
I was again with the happy regiment to which properly I belonged.</p>

grave&mdash;&#8203;Courage at sea&mdash;&#8203;England.</p></blockquote>

<p class="drop-cap4"><span class="smcap1">Routine</span> of duty, and responsibilities connected with what was
called “full charge” of the regiment, now devolved upon me.
Much had to be learnt in respect to official matters relating to my
new position, nor could it be so except from so-called “subordinates”
attached in those days to hospitals pertaining to British troops; to them
I had, therefore, to refer, and from them gain needed information.</p>

<p>The aspect of cantonments during the next few months much
resembled that of the previous hot season: pleasure and gaiety at
suitable times, but not to interfere with duty. Among the soldiers
unhappily there occurred, as before, great sickness and mortality, the
line of new-made graves in the cemetery filled the previous year, and
then numbering sixty, being duplicated and exceeded by one on this
occasion.</p>

<p>Late in September, orders of readiness to proceed to Calcutta, there
to embark for England, were appreciated in different senses by the
younger officers and by the older, the latter contrasting in their minds
their relative rates of pay in India, where the rupee had its standard
value, and at home. With few exceptions the juniors expressed themselves
as delighted at the prospect.</p>

<p>Then came the customary order that, prior to its departure, men who
so desired should be given the opportunity to <i>volunteer</i> from the
regiment to certain specified corps whose period of service in India
had yet some years to run. A special officer was appointed to superintend
the proceeding. Applicants for the privilege were subjected
to physical examination; their defaulter sheets and “small books”<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_37" id="Page_37">37</a></span>
looked at, after which, if deemed eligible, and under forty years of age,
they were accepted, and received a bounty equivalent in amount to
£3 sterling. To those whose age exceeded that limit no bounty was
officially given, but a corresponding sum was granted from regimental
funds as they existed at the time. As an unfortunate part of the
system the canteen was kept open throughout; there the bounty money
was quickly spent, with the result that throughout the week devoted
to “volunteering” scenes of irregularity became numerous; parades
and discipline were in abeyance, drunkenness and riot took their
places.</p>

<p>As the arrival of our regiment, and its return from active service, had
been made the occasion for a round of entertainments, so was now its
prospective departure; civil officials and officers of native regiments
joined in turn to show attention to the Buffs, and thus testify good
fellowship and friendly sentiments towards the corps. Then came the
final official ordeal; namely, inspection by the venerable officer commanding
the Division. General Watson, then said to be of the old
school, had seen much war service; personally amiable, but so full
of years that, on the occasion of the parade in question, he was unable
to mount a horse, and so perforce witnessed the formality of the march
past while he remained on foot.</p>

<p>Boats of the kinds already described now lay ready moored to the
bank of the Jumna for our reception. The General gave as a last
entertainment a sumptuous <i xml:lang="fr" lang="fr">déjeûner</i>, to which were invited the principal
officers, civil and military, of the station. Healths proposed and
drunk to in champagne; good wishes expressed; leave-takings gone
through; then all take their respective places; bands play “Auld lang
syne,” “The girls we left behind us,” “Home, sweet home,” etc.;
we are speedily on board; the moorings untied; the “fleet” in
movement with the placid stream; from the ramparts of the fort heavy
guns fire a “Royal salute” in honour of our regiment. Thus begins
the journey <span class="locked">homewards.<a name="FNanchor_51" id="FNanchor_51" href="#Footnote_51" class="fnanchor">51</a></span></p>

<p>We are speedily at the fort of Chunar, built by the Mahomedan
conquerors of India, from Hindoo temples destroyed for that purpose;
captured by Major&mdash;&#8203;afterwards Sir Hector Monro in <span class="locked">1764,<a name="FNanchor_52" id="FNanchor_52" href="#Footnote_52" class="fnanchor">52</a></span> but still
held semi-sacred by the descendants of those whose shrines were so
desecrated. On an open tract of ground in its near vicinity, a series
of barracks and small houses were occupied by pensioners of the East
India Company.</p>

<p>Benares, viewed from the Ganges, is picturesque, and in some respects<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_38" id="Page_38">38</a></span>
beautiful. Houses of red sandstone, their fanciful windows, projecting
balconies, and flat roofs, giving to them a character all their
own. The city extends from the very edge of the river; its numerous
temples and ghats&mdash;&#8203;the latter crowded with devotees and others, wearing
garments of many colours, giving the scene a picturesque aspect.
Some of the temples and ghats present a dilapidated appearance;
but others, especially that of Visheswar&mdash;&#8203;dedicated to Siva&mdash;&#8203;is resplendent
with gold gilding. Another striking object is the Mosque of
Arungzebe, erected in the reign of that monarch from Hindoo temples
destroyed for that purpose. Near the golden temple, in the heart of
the city, is the no less famous well, named after Manic Karnik, believed
by votaries to be filled with “the sudor of Vishnu,” and at its bottom
to contain Truth. At a short distance is the Astronomical Observatory,
erected by Jai Singh, <span class="smcap smaller">A.D.</span> 1693.</p>

<p>History records that this ancient city continued during many generations
to be the metropolis of Aryan civilization in India. It was at
Sarnath, a suburb of Kasi, as Benares was then called, that in the sixth
century <span class="smcap smaller">B.C.</span> Gautama preached the doctrines of <span class="locked">Karma<a name="FNanchor_53" id="FNanchor_53" href="#Footnote_53" class="fnanchor">53</a></span> and
<span class="locked">Nirvana.<a name="FNanchor_54" id="FNanchor_54" href="#Footnote_54" class="fnanchor">54</a></span> There Buddhism assumed its sway, which it retained till
the fourth century <span class="smcap smaller">A.D.</span>, when it gave way before a revival of Hindooism,
in regard to which religion Benares has ever since been considered
its most sacred city.</p>

<p>Here we first witnessed the celebration of the Ramdeela festival. It
consists in a representation of the more important incidents connected
with the abduction of Sita; the chase, the siege, and capture of
Ravanu’s stronghold; her rescue, the ordeal of fire, to test her purity,
and reception by Rama. As noted at the time, the performances, interpreted
by the light of legend, gave to them considerable interest.</p>

<p>Resuming our river journey, we met a fleet of boats similar to
our own, having on board a party of the 29th Regiment, in progress
towards the north-west. The effective portion of the regiment was
marching to its destination from Ghazepore, at which place it had been
stationed during the two years it had been in India. From a strength
of close upon 1,200, it had been in that short time reduced, by fever
and cholera, to little over 400 effectives. Alas! out of those remaining,
great were to be the losses at Ferozeshah, and other frontier battles,
then in the near future.</p>

<p>There was nothing in the aspect of Ghazepore, or the buildings
connected with it, to account for the havoc in life and health sustained
by the 29th Regiment. A large extent of grass-covered plain separates<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_39" id="Page_39">39</a></span>
the station proper from the river. On it stands a monument, erected in
memory of Lord <span class="locked">Cornwallis,<a name="FNanchor_55" id="FNanchor_55" href="#Footnote_55" class="fnanchor">55</a></span> who died near this place, while in progress
up the Ganges. That monument, surrounded by tamarisk bushes,
above which its summit rises, bears upon it a memorial figure by
Flaxman. The range of barracks and the church are the only other
buildings that are immediately seen. A visit to the native town brought
us to the ruins of what had been the palace of Mir Cossim Ali Khan,
whose forces were defeated, and power destroyed, at Buxar, in 1764,
by Major Munro. The graceful proportion of its pillars, arches, and
general aspect struck us forcibly, though the building itself is in a
state of decay, as are also the numerous smaller ranges by which,
in former days, it was surrounded; nor is it more than eighty years
since that decay began. Other points of interest connected with
Ghazepore include the growth and manufacture of poppy and opium,
roses and their otto. A breeding stud for cavalry and artillery horses is
here maintained by Government.</p>

<p>Buxar, our next halting place, was one of three places at which
breeding studs were maintained by “the Company,” the other two being
Ghazepore, already mentioned, and Haupur. It would appear, however,
that all these are insufficient to meet the requirements of the
army, and that consequently importation of horses from the Cape and
Australia has had to be resorted to.</p>

<p>Dinapore, then occupied by <span class="locked">European<a name="FNanchor_56" id="FNanchor_56" href="#Footnote_56" class="fnanchor">56</a></span> artillery, one British and
three native regiments of infantry, for the assigned purpose of guarding
against possible incursion by the Nepaulese, whose relations towards the
Government of India were somewhat strained. It was said that for
a number of years the terms of the Treaty of 1816 between Sir David
Ochterlony and the chief of the Ghoorkas were faithfully adhered to by
the latter; but that in recent times signs of disaffection had begun
to show themselves. As an outcome of the Treaty in question, some
of the Nepaulese took military service under the Company, they being
enrolled in what became known as Ghoorka regiments. For some
reason, the nature of which did not transpire, several days elapsed
before our journey was resumed.</p>

<p>Impressions of the place were not particularly favourable; that it has
attractions of a kind, however, seems evident, as families and various
retired officers were said to make it their residence. A few miles
distant is the city of Patna&mdash;&#8203;Pataliputra of the Hindoos, and Palibothra<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_40" id="Page_40">40</a></span>
of the Greeks&mdash;&#8203;famous in relation to British history as the scene of
murder by Kossim Khan, in 1763, of 200 Englishmen, besides 2,000
sepoys; to become again noted in connection with events of 1857.
On our way to and from that city we noticed by the roadside the now
disused grain store, erected in 1769&ndash;70, to receive grain against the
great famine then prevailing in Behar, in respect to which it is related
that “the tanks were dried up, the springs ceased to reach the surface,
and within the first nine months of 1770 one-third of the population
of Lower Bengal were carried off by want of food.”</p>

<p>The 62nd, occupying barracks at Dinapore, entertained the officers
of the Buffs on a scale of hospitality and in a manner to be compared
only with regimental festivities pictured in the works of Charles Lever.
“The Springers,” as in those days they loved to be called, were under
orders for Umballah, much delighted at prospects of service therein
implied; for the state of affairs in the Punjab, already mentioned, had
from day to day continued to increase in gravity. The feeling of gallant
hilarity was expressed in a somewhat demonstrative manner in extemporary
song by one of their officers in early morning hours, while
mess had not yet broken <span class="locked">up.<a name="FNanchor_57" id="FNanchor_57" href="#Footnote_57" class="fnanchor">57</a></span> Of our festive hosts on that occasion
scarcely one was alive fourteen months thereafter.</p>

<p>Resuming our journey, our fleet was moored about sunset under
a somewhat high alluvial bank, such as in this part of the river course
are of frequent occurrence. To several of our soldiers the result was
fatal; during the night cholera attacked with violence, and claimed
them as victims. As we continued on our way next day the malady
seemed to be left behind us.</p>

<p>Monghyr, at which we speedily arrived, is interesting in several
respects. To the cession of its rather imposing fort was immediately
ascribed the massacre of our countrymen at Patna, as already
mentioned. Near this place, in the year of that occurrence, 1763,
a mutiny occurred, in which not only native but also European troops
were concerned, nor was it until several of their number had been blown
from guns by order of Major Munro, already mentioned, that the outbreak
was suppressed.</p>

<p>At this place more hospitality was shown us. While yet at some
distance from our halting ground, an invitation reached the regiment<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_41" id="Page_41">41</a></span>
from Mr. Hodson, then occupying the position of Joint Magistrate and
Collector, that officers should dine with him; while to the soldiers,
“refreshments” would be served on tables arranged for the purpose as
near as possible to the boats. Thus did our host express the compliment
he desired to show the regiment, and very highly were his successful
endeavours appreciated.</p>

<p>Our next halting place was Bhaugulpore. There, in 1827, the Buffs
were stationed, while as yet our frontier line was comparatively little
advanced,&mdash;&#8203;Bhurtpore only the previous year captured. In the range
of hills that thence extend in a south-westerly direction are various wild
Santhal tribes, very low in civilization, devil-worshippers by <span class="locked">custom;<a name="FNanchor_58" id="FNanchor_58" href="#Footnote_58" class="fnanchor">58</a></span>
their weapons were chiefly bows and arrows; their own ethnic alliance
believed to be Dravidian.</p>

<p>At the time referred to the number of steamers on the Ganges was
small; the length of inland voyage from three to four weeks. Officers
and others availing themselves of that mode of transit considered that
they were travelling “by express.” It was customary with some to
spend the period of sick leave, extending in certain instances to six
months, on board comfortably fitted up “budgerows” on the river;
tradesmen also arranged the kind of boat so called as travelling shops,
and these different classes of persons and craft gave certain variety to
our river voyage. Arrived at Rajmahal, the former capital of Northern
Bengal, but now a ruined mass out of which stood a few broken
shafts of what had been pillars of black marble. The ruined palace
dates back only to <span class="smcap smaller">A.D.</span> 1630. Sultan Shujah, by whom it was founded,
elder brother of Arungzebe, was at the time Governor of Bengal. He
was soon thereafter deposed by the latter-named monarch; fled to
Arracan, and there perished miserably. When visited by Bishop
Heber, the ruins of the palace were in comparatively good preservation;
subsequently, however, their materials were utilised in the construction
of the magnificent palace of Moorshedabad.</p>

<p>Two incidents now occurred, each characteristic in its way. A
soldier having clandestinely obtained bazaar spirit, was thereby rendered
drunk and desperate; boasting of his courageous deeds, he was
challenged to “take a header” into the Ganges. He did so, and
appeared no more. The other was the infliction of one hundred lashes
on the back of a hardened old offender, simply as punishment, for
none of those who knew the man expected that it would have any
deterrent effect in the future.</p>

<p>Entering the Bhauguruttee branch of the Ganges, our fleet was soon<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_42" id="Page_42">42</a></span>
at <span class="locked">Berhampore,<a name="FNanchor_59" id="FNanchor_59" href="#Footnote_59" class="fnanchor">59</a></span> whence I had started up the river little more than
two years previous. Again, but now as one of a body of officers,
I partook of hospitality shown to the whole regiment by General Raper.
A breakfast given at the palace of the <span class="locked">Nawab;<a name="FNanchor_60" id="FNanchor_60" href="#Footnote_60" class="fnanchor">60</a></span> excursions by land and
river, presentation to His Highness, permission to visit different parts of
his palace, including jewel-room and its contents, were so many items
connected with ovation given to us as representatives of a distinguished
regiment. All this was wound up by dinner at the house of the General,
followed by a “Reception,” during which I had the pleasure of again
meeting some “old” friends.</p>

<p>Among the guests at that Reception was “the Khasjeewalla of
Gwalior,” implicated, as we have seen, in the disturbances that led to
the recent campaign in that State. For a time he was interned at
Agra, but latterly had been “at large,” under surveillance of our host;
his demeanour towards those by whom the victory at Punniar was
gained, by no means agreeable; but under the circumstances anything
else could hardly have been looked for.</p>

<p>Resuming our journey, we soon arrived at and glided past the village
of <span class="locked">Plassee,<a name="FNanchor_61" id="FNanchor_61" href="#Footnote_61" class="fnanchor">61</a></span> but the actual field so named had long since been swept
away by the river by which we were being carried along. At <span class="locked">Kulnah,<a name="FNanchor_62" id="FNanchor_62" href="#Footnote_62" class="fnanchor">62</a></span>
indications of flow and reflux of the tide were evident. There we met
the fleet of boats, similar to our own, by which the 10th Regiment was
being conveyed inland. Mutual salutations passed between us, but
little at the time thought I of close association subsequently in store for
me in relation to it. A short distance more, and we passed the village
of Balaghurree, its inhabitants, those and their descendants, who, having
been left by their relatives to die by the side of the river, were rescued
through the good offices of missionaries.</p>

<p>We were nearing the end of this river journey. In quick succession<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_43" id="Page_43">43</a></span>
our fleet glided past the important native towns of Bandel, noted on
account of its Roman Catholic convent; Hooghly, for its college; and
Chinsurah, already mentioned. Now we were off Chandernagore, on
the battlements of which waved the tricolour. In 1757 that little
settlement was captured from the French by Clive, aided by Admiral
Watson, who, for the attack, brought thither his frigate carrying seventy-four
guns&mdash;&#8203;a feat not now possible because of the silting up of the
river. The place was shortly afterwards restored to the French, to
again fall to the British during the Revolutionary War, and finally
to be ceded to them in accordance with the Peace Treaty of 1816.</p>

<p>We are well within the influence of the tide. As it recedes we are
borne towards Calcutta. A forest of masts becomes more and more
dense; tall chimneys on either bank tell of factories; the clang of
hammers, of ship-building yards; the odour of tar, that we are nearing
our port; and great is the surprise with which our north-country servants
and followers look upon the unwonted sight. We pass the Armenian
Ghat. It is an open space, on which various funeral pyres blaze and
smoke; vultures and adjutant-birds are waiting for such human remains
as may be left: the scene most unpleasant to look at. For many years
past that which has just been alluded to has ceased to exist, a crematorium
having taken its place. We arrive at Calcutta; the regiment
lands, and marches into Fort William.</p>

<p>Preparations for departure proceeded rapidly, and with a will.
Hospitality to the regiment and attentions in other ways were shown by
some of the higher officials. At Government House some of us had
an opportunity of being present at the dinners and balls, for which it
was then, as since, well and favourably known; also at parties given by
the Chief Justice Sir Lawrence Peel, in the spacious house occupied
by him at Garden Reach.</p>

<p>The issue to men and officers of the Bronze Star respectively for
Punniar and Maharajpore took place, but without pomp and circumstance
such as most properly at the present time are observed on
similar occasions. Being informed that the stars in question, composed
of metal of Mahratta cannon that had wrought heavy injury to our
regiments, were in readiness, in company with my friend <span class="locked">Maude,<a name="FNanchor_63" id="FNanchor_63" href="#Footnote_63" class="fnanchor">63</a></span>
I drove to the Mint, and there, from two heaps on the floor, of those
decorations, selected one each, leaving both for the purpose of our
respective names being engraved on them. A few days thereafter we
returned, and having received from an employé of that establishment<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_44" id="Page_44">44</a></span>
the much-prized decorations, we placed them in our pockets, and drove
back to Fort William.</p>

<p>Soon <span class="locked">thereafter,<a name="FNanchor_64" id="FNanchor_64" href="#Footnote_64" class="fnanchor">64</a></span> the Headquarter portion of the regiment was on
board the <i>Monarch</i>, and away from India homeward bound. Our
ship, one of a class by which troops were wont in favoured instances
to be conveyed between England and her great Eastern
dependency: graceful to look at, roomy, well fitted up, sumptuously
provided&mdash;&#8203;veritable floating palaces. The comfort of the soldier, his
wife and children, secured to an extent that under subsequent regulations
became impossible. With regard to officers, “stoppages”
for messing was on the scale already mentioned. I became entitled
to “head money,” as on the outward voyage, notwithstanding
that I was in the performance of my ordinary duties with my own
regiment.</p>

<p>Nine weeks of uneventful life passed, and our ship was at St. Helena.
Very shortly thereafter, parties of us, arranged for the purpose, landed
at James’s Town, the population of which seemed to consist almost
entirely of mulattoes of low type, physically and intellectually; the
balance were of pure negro type. We learned, moreover, that slave
ships with their human cargo on board were from time to time
brought to the island by British ships of war, very harrowing details
being given of the sufferings of the unfortunate captives on board.
At the time of our visit the garrison of the island comprised the St.
Helena regiment and a battery of artillery.</p>

<p>An excursion to Longwood proved to be a somewhat arduous
undertaking&mdash;&#8203;carriages ricketty, horses like living skeletons, lame, and
weak, the ascent steep, rugged. The six or seven miles to be
traversed required several hours for completion of the task. At last
we were at and within the barn-like, dilapidated building in which
took place the closing life scenes of Napoleon; its surroundings a
tangled mass of brambles and other shrubs. In the building itself his
library room, then partly filled with hay; near it the stable, having
stalls for six horses. In a pretty valley close by, under the shade
of the then famous willow, was the open tomb whence the remains
of the great Frenchman were removed in 1840 for transport to the
banks of the Seine.</p>

<p>Continuing our voyage, an incident which happened during its
further progress deserves record. While sailing under the influence
of the trade winds, a sailor fell from aloft into the sea. Quickly
were life-buoys slipped, the ship brought round, a boat lowered,
while from top-gallant cross-trees an officer directed the crew<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_45" id="Page_45">45</a></span>
towards the man struggling in mid ocean. Soon, from the bows of
the boat one of its crew dived, for the drowning man had already
begun to sink; a brief interval, and both rescuer and rescued were
hauled on board. With no loss of time the boat was alongside and
on board ship, the man restored to animation and life by means used
to that end. Many years thereafter, meeting Mr. Cloete, who performed
the gallant act, we talked over the incident and its surrounding circumstances.</p>

<p>Another month at sea, and the <i>Monarch</i> swings at anchor off
Gravesend; the Buffs, absent from England since 1821, <span class="locked">disembark;<a name="FNanchor_65" id="FNanchor_65" href="#Footnote_65" class="fnanchor">65</a></span>
the ordeal of the Custom House gone through; the march on foot
begun, for as yet a railway had not been opened. Evening was far
advanced when the regiment arrived at Chatham, where it was to be
temporarily quartered. In accordance with the routine of that day,
nothing whatever had been prepared in barracks for our men,
save that doors were open, displaying bare walls, bed cots devoid of
mattress or bedding; while for the officers, not even quarters had
been assigned; they were expected to look after themselves. Night
had far advanced before duty rendered necessary by such a state of
things was so far complete as to allow of our going in search of hotels
in which to spend the few hours that remained till daylight. It was
not till two o’clock in the morning that we had “dinner,” in course
of which various allusions were made to the “hospitality” accorded
to us as a body on the occasion of our return, as contrasted with
what we had experienced in India. Two days had to elapse before
the regimental baggage arrived, though the distance over which it
had to be conveyed was no more than ten miles; nor was it till
then that straw for the men’s cots was issued by the barrack stores,
and they initiated into the art of stuffing their allotted quantities into
their palliasses. This was the beginning of our Home Service.</p>

<p class="drop-cap3"><span class="smcap1">Time-expired</span> and some other classes of men not conducive
to regimental efficiency being discharged, soldiers and officers
“set up” in respect to kits and equipments, the order to proceed to
Chichester was received with acclamation, for in those days the
reputation accorded to Chatham as a station was by no means
flattering. At the end of May the Buffs marched merrily away; that
is, marched on foot, for railway communication had not yet connected
Chatham with the outside world. A few miles got over,
and we were at Blue Bell Hill, the ascent of which revealed to us
in great variety and luxuriance forest, flowers, and grass-covered
patches; the summit reached, an extensive view of the lovely vale of
Kent stretched away beneath us, and in our near vicinity the cromlech
called “Kittscotty <span class="locked">House”<a name="FNanchor_66" id="FNanchor_66" href="#Footnote_66" class="fnanchor">66</a></span> attracted the notice of those among us who
were of antiquarian tastes.</p>

<p>At Maidstone the regiment had its first experience of transit by rail.
The art of “training” and detraining troops had not yet been learnt;
hence delay such as would now be culpable was unavoidable before
soldiers and their baggage were in their places, and a start made. The
line being open only to Redhill, all had there to alight, the short journey
to Reigate being performed on foot. Arrived at that pretty town, we had
our initiation into the system of billeting, the officers being “told off” to
the principal hotel, the comforts of which made us speedily forget whatever<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_47" id="Page_47">47</a></span>
disagreeables had attended the proceedings of the day. Continuing
our journey, we arrived in succession at Petworth and Horsham, at each
of which towns we similarly enjoyed our billets; thence to Chichester.
The approach of a country gentleman to our Commanding Officer
attracted our attention; the “halt” was sounded; the word passed on
that, on hospitality intent, he had provided “refreshments” for all of us.
His kind attention was highly appreciated, acknowledgments expressed,
he himself invited to dinner with the officers at our new destination;
then the march resumed, the Buffs marching into quarters at Chichester
on the fourth day of their very pleasant journey.</p>

<p>Compared and contrasted with a march in India, that now over
presented some striking points of difference, not the least of which
were the absence of hackeries, bullocks, camels, elephants, and that
heterogeneous collection of “followers” comprised under the name of
“the bazaar.” Instead of tents and camp fare we had comfortable if
expensive entertainment at hotels, while our daily line of route lay
through rich, varied, and beautiful English scenery. But some of our
party looked back with fond remembrances to the freedom and feeling
of exhilaration attending the early morning march in India, dusty roads
and sundry other drawbacks notwithstanding.</p>

<p>The huts, literally “baraques,” assigned to us were old, dating from
the Peninsular War. From the restoration of peace they had been left
unoccupied until quite recently, when they were utilised in the first
instance for the temporary reception of men enlisted to form a new
44th Regiment, and subsequently by the 55th on its return from China.
The <span class="locked">officer<a name="FNanchor_67" id="FNanchor_67" href="#Footnote_67" class="fnanchor">67</a></span> who held the position of Barrack-master boasted of a very
honourable military “record,” he having been, if not the very first,
among the first to mount the breach at Badajos; yet, like many others
of his day, he had been thrown on half-pay at the conclusion of the war,
and so deprived of the chance of rising in the service. From the
residents of the cathedral city and its neighbourhood our officers received
much civility and hospitality. The cathedral, used as a stable in the
days of Cromwell, but long since “restored,” was often visited, the
circumstance that it had been transported from Selsey to its present site
adding to it many points of historical interest. But to some among
us Chichester had the great disadvantage of not yet being in direct
communication by railway with London, the journey to and from the
metropolis having to be performed by coach. A Bill had then only
recently been passed authorizing such a railway.</p>

<p>An event occurred while we occupied those huts which marked in its<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_48" id="Page_48">48</a></span>
way a stage in the advance of comfort and well-being of the soldier.
Hitherto his “regulation” daily meals were only two; namely, breakfast
at 8 a.m., dinner at 1 p.m.&mdash;&#8203;an interval of nineteen hours being thus left
during which he had to be without food, unless he happened to have spare
money wherewith to supply himself at the regimental canteen or public-house
in town. The obvious drawbacks of such a state of things
had long been subject of representation, but hitherto unsuccessfully.
Now, however, in 1845, authority was issued granting the issue to
the men of a tea meal at 4 p.m. For a time the order was resented;
that a soldier should condescend to <i>tea</i> was held to be
against the natural order of things, and to mark effeminacy. Soon,
however, the measure was appreciated by all, and drunkenness, at that
time the bane of the soldier, underwent a remarkable decrease.</p>

<p>Winchester, to which we next proceeded, had “for ages” been
looked upon as a favourite station by regiments. To some of us
the many historical associations connected with that ancient city
became so many sources of interest and objects of study. The commodious
barracks, occupied by the Buffs and Scots Fusilier Guards
stood upon the site of what had been a royal palace, and still earlier
a castle. The city itself dates back to <span class="smcap smaller">B.C.</span> 800. The cathedral&mdash;&#8203;to
which our visits became very frequent&mdash;&#8203;occupies a site whereon
stood, during the years of Roman occupation, an altar to Apollo, and,
in times still more ancient, one devoted to sun worship. Among other
places of interest in and around the city were the buildings to which
more particularly are referred the legendary stories of Saint Swithin
of rainy fame; the ancient hospital of St. Cross, at which travellers
might claim a dole of bread and beer; the world-famous school and
college, both founded by William of Wykeham, <span class="smcap smaller">A.D.</span> 1324&ndash;1404.
Among favourite walks was that to “the Labyrinth,” on the summit
of St. Catherine’s Hill; several alongside the banks of the Itchin,
sacred to the memory of Izaak Walton, and that to Twyford. In the
churchyard of that place stood a remarkably fine specimen of a
yew tree, such as, in times long gone by, were preserved in burial
places, and so held in a manner sacred&mdash;&#8203;for the purpose of supplying
yeomen with long-bows, in the use of which weapon those of England
so much excelled. The hill from which, in Cromwell’s time, the city
was bombarded was a favourite walk among us. So was the village of
Horsely, some few miles distant; its church associated with the author
of <i>The Christian Year</i>, the choir, consisting of various very ordinary
musical instruments, including a violin and clarionet.</p>

<p>On a day late in January, 1846, the Buffs proceeded by rail to
Portsmouth. Bitterly cold, wet and windy, was the weather; the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_49" id="Page_49">49</a></span>
streets of that great naval port in some places inundated by the tide,
so that progress along them was by no means pleasant. By the
floating steam bridge the harbour was crossed, our regiment divided
so as to occupy barracks at Forton and Haslar respectively. With the
companies proceeding to the latter place I was detailed for duty.
The quarters consisted of huts, the one assigned to me so situated
as to afford from its window a near view of Spithead, and of the
magnificent and graceful sailing men-of-war vessels anchored there or
manœuvring in the Solent.</p>

<p>An early opportunity was taken to visit the great Naval Hospital,
near to which my temporary residence was situated; and although in
these notes professional recollections are for the most part avoided,
one of the results of that visit was sufficiently interesting to be made
an exception to that rule. On a portion of the adjoining grounds, and
set apart for the purpose, a considerable number of mentally afflicted
patients, together with their attendants or keepers&mdash;&#8203;their costumes in
every respect similar to those worn by the patients&mdash;&#8203;were engaged with
apparent heartiness in what was a “rollicking” dance, to the notes of
several violins, the performers on which were presumably patients and
attendants. In the treatment of the patients all coercive measures
were absent; free association among them was permitted from
time to time, as we had seen; such of them as desired to work or
labour were given every opportunity of doing so, and for the special
benefit of those who desired to follow&mdash;&#8203;in imagination&mdash;&#8203;their seafaring
life, a lake with its fleet of boats was provided. Such were some of the
measures adopted in respect to this class of patients in 1846. The
<i>Victory</i> and other “sights” connected with the great naval port
were visited; but in respect to these it appears unnecessary to enter
into details, except that all associations on board relating to England’s
naval hero were duly venerated.</p>

<p>Without previous warning news circulated that the Sikhs, in great
force, had crossed the Sutlej, and thus invaded British territory.
Then quickly followed intelligence that four severely contested battles
against them had been fought, their forces defeated, Lahore
occupied; Dhuleep Singh, a child, brought by his mother, the
Maharanee, to the camp of Lord Hardinge, the Governor-General,
by whom his “submission” was accepted. In those battles many
officers fell, with whom, collectively or individually, we had but
recently, as already mentioned, been most pleasantly associated, and
whose fate we now mourned. As fuller details became known, it
appeared that on December 12, 1845, the Sikh armies, under the
command of Lal Singh, crossed the Sutlej, and by the 16th had<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_50" id="Page_50">50</a></span>
strongly fortified a position taken up by them on the left bank of that
river. On the 13th the forces under Sir Hugh Gough attacked and
drove them from their position at Moodkee. Following them to
Ferozeshuhur, at which place they had meanwhile entrenched themselves,
he renewed his attack upon them on the 21st, the terrible battle
which was to ensue continuing during that and two following days,&mdash;&#8203;the
issue, for some time uncertain, ultimately being in favour of our
troops. There it was that the 62nd, with whom but lately we had
been happy at Dinapore, having begun its advance against those
entrenchments with 23 officers, lost 17 of that number&mdash;&#8203;8 killed on the
field and 9 wounded. But still another position, and it at Aliwal, was
taken up by the retreating Sikhs, where, on January 28, 1846, they
were attacked by the forces under Sir Harry Smith. There the 16th
Lancers performed the gallant deed of charging through a ghola (or
mass) of Sikhs, their substitute for a square; then repeated the
charge, destroying the enemy thus rode down. In the performance
of that heroic feat the regiment lost upwards of one hundred men
killed and wounded&mdash;&#8203;that is, nearly one-third of their effective
strength. On February 10 the Sikhs were defeated, their forces
destroyed up at Sobraon, though at very heavy cost in killed and
wounded to the British. On that occasion the 50th lost in killed
and wounded 12 officers, nearly all of whom were personal acquaintances,
more or less intimate of my own, and in addition 227 men. The
10th Foot, with which I was destined to be subsequently associated, had
in killed and wounded 3 officers, 3 non-commissioned officers, and
127 rank and file. Other regiments engaged suffered heavily, for the
Sikhs contended for their nationality and class interests. The facts
related give significance to the intentions of Lord Ellenborough
expressed in Gwalior, to lead the troops thither direct upon the
Punjab frontier. That plan was disallowed, and so two years were
given to the Sikh leaders wherein to complete their arrangements for
taking the offensive.</p>

<p>Orders from the Horse Guards directed that three infantry regiments&mdash;&#8203;namely,
the 8th, 24th, and 32nd&mdash;&#8203;should proceed to India without
delay. No less than six weeks elapsed, however, before they sailed, the
circumstance itself illustrating the state of unreadiness for emergencies
which then existed. The three regiments named were destined to take
their parts in arduous service in India, the first at Mooltan, the second
at Chilianwalla, the third at Lucknow.</p>

<p>The establishment of what was to be called our “Experimental
Squadron” at this time was justly looked upon as an event of great
importance. The fleet so designated consisted for the most part of<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_51" id="Page_51">51</a></span>
sailing ships of war, but comprised also several steam vessels, propelled
by paddles, the whole providing for spectators an unusual and magnificent
sight as they lay anchored at <span class="locked">Spithead.<a name="FNanchor_68" id="FNanchor_68" href="#Footnote_68" class="fnanchor">68</a></span> Between the lines
passed the Royal yacht, having on board Her Majesty the Queen.
From the sides of each successive ship thundered salutes; from
their decks rose strains of the National Anthem; from their yards,
manned for the occasion, came hearty cheers of loyalty. A brief
interval succeeded; then simultaneously, as if by combined movement,
dropped the huge white sails; these gradually filled to the
breeze; away glided the fleet, followed by hundreds of yachts, boats,
and craft of all sorts. About this time also the then strange sight
was for the first time witnessed of a war ship, the <i>Rattler</i>, sliding,
as it were, out of Portsmouth Harbour, destitute of sail or paddle, the
first of her kind propelled by the Archimedean screw.</p>

<p>The arrival at Spithead of the Russian war-ship <i>Prince of
Warsaw</i>, having on board the Grand Duke Constantine, escorted by
two other vessels, was to Portsmouth an event of interest and political
importance. The officers of the Imperial frigate were entertained at
dinner by those of the Buffs: an attention much appreciated by them.
Next day a party of us were most civilly received on board their
ship; in the course of that visit the circumstance made clear that our
hosts were well acquainted with the English language, as also with
insular manners and customs. But great was the contrast between
conditions on board and those of the “Experimental Squadron.”
The Russian sailors untidy and slovenly in appearance, the terms of
their service severe, inasmuch as after a period of twenty years in
the Navy or Army the reward to which they had to look forward
was&mdash;&#8203;emancipation; for as yet they were serfs. According to their
own accounts, the period of obligatory service by officers was twenty-one
years. Leave of absence, if exceeding a total of one year during
that period, had to be made up by them; and if on any occasion
absent from their ships or regiments for more than four days, their
pay for that time is withheld from them. We congratulated ourselves
that our position was in those respects more fortunate than theirs.</p>

<p>About the same time Ibrahim Pasha came among us. The circumstance
that the comfort or otherwise of travellers across the desert
between Cairo and Suez depended much on measures directed by the
Viceroy of Egypt, added to other considerations, no doubt moved
Admiralty and Horse Guards to order that every attention should be
shown to His Highness. Among other displays for his gratification<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_52" id="Page_52">52</a></span>
the troops in garrison were paraded on Southsea Common. As he
rode along the line, the impression produced by his appearance and
style was by no means favourable; about fifty years of age, bloated in
aspect, cruel and relentless in expression, he looked in these respects
a true descendant of his father, Mehemet Ali.</p>

<p>In quarters at Portsmouth were the 13th Light Infantry, then recently
returned from India, their honours thick upon them, as “The
Illustrious Garrison.” The 74th, re-converted into Highlanders,
paraded for the first time in their newly-acquired uniform. In those
regiments and in the Buffs there was a large leaven of old soldiers who
had not risen beyond the ranks; the majority of the non-commissioned
officers were men whose locks were grey, some with sons serving as
soldiers; recruits were relatively few in number; barrack-room courts-martial
in full operation; crime, at least that <i>officially</i> brought forward,
comparatively rare, though what in reality is quite another thing. That
the regiments so constituted were capable of the most arduous service
was proved by that of the Buffs in Gwalior, the 13th in Affghanistan.</p>

<p>The receipt from the War Office of a letter containing an offer of
promotion conditional on proceeding to the West Coast of Africa,
though a surprise, was not altogether an agreeable one, for hitherto the
usual designation of that part of the world had been “The White
Man’s Grave.” Official <span class="locked">reports<a name="FNanchor_69" id="FNanchor_69" href="#Footnote_69" class="fnanchor">69</a></span> regarding it referred to no later date
than 1825; but this is the result of reference to them:&mdash;&#8203;In February
of that year a party of white soldiers, 105 strong, arrived at the
Isles de Loss, near Sierra Leone; at the end of eighteen months 54 of
their number were dead by fever, 8 by other diseases, 21 invalided
back to England, 20 remained on those islands, scarcely any of them
fit for duty. Then followed a table by which, at the Gambia, the
annual mortality of white men was shown to have been at the rate of
1,500 per 1,000 average strength. On the other hand, the proffered
promotion would advance me over one hundred and forty of my
seniors; increased <span class="locked">pay<a name="FNanchor_70" id="FNanchor_70" href="#Footnote_70" class="fnanchor">70</a></span> would be an immediate advantage, and, in the
event of survival, increased departmental position. The upshot of
thought given to the subject was that, in the expression common to
the time, I volunteered for the West Coast.</p>

<p>With regret and sorrow I <span class="locked">ceased<a name="FNanchor_71" id="FNanchor_71" href="#Footnote_71" class="fnanchor">71</a></span> to be a member of the distinguished
<span class="locked">old<a name="FNanchor_72" id="FNanchor_72" href="#Footnote_72" class="fnanchor">72</a></span> regiment, with the traditions and history of which, like
all its other members, I had become familiar. I had, moreover, formed<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_53" id="Page_53">53</a></span>
<span class="locked">friendships<a name="FNanchor_73" id="FNanchor_73" href="#Footnote_73" class="fnanchor">73</a></span> such as subsequent experience taught me existed only
between regimental officers during early life. The kindly expressions
addressed to me by the Commanding Officer on the occasion of the
farewell dinner, to which I was invited, impressed me in a manner not
to be forgotten, and are here alluded to as indicating the relations
then existing between medical and battalion officers.</p>

<p>No regular line of communication existed between England and the
West Coast of Africa; consequently, when orders to embark were
received, passage had to be negotiated for through the medium of
a ship’s broker, and so advantage taken of trading brigs or other small
craft proceeding, at irregular times, on voyages thither, either from the
Thames or Mersey. Several months elapsed before transport was
obtained, and, meanwhile, time was spent in visiting places interesting
in themselves or by reason of past associations.</p>

<p>At this time public attention became aroused to a state of ferment,
ostensibly because of the death of a soldier of the 7th Hussars at
Hounslow, after having been flogged to the extent of 150 lashes, in
pursuance of a sentence to that effect by court-martial, for having
violently and dangerously assaulted a non-commissioned officer of his
regiment. Medical opinion differed <i xml:lang="la" lang="la">in toto</i> as to whether the death
was, or was not, the effect of the corporal punishment. But the case
was taken up and energetically debated, not only at public meetings
convened for the purpose, but also in both Houses of Parliament.
Whatever may have been its intrinsic merits, the case in question
undoubtedly led to the introduction of a Bill, the outcome of which
was that the maximum number of lashes to be inflicted was thenceforward
reduced to fifty. Instead of “unlimited” service as heretofore,
the period of a soldier’s engagement was reduced to ten years; and so,
it was hoped, encouragement held out for a better class of recruits
to join the ranks; desertion would be diminished, and the general
efficiency of the service increased.</p>

<p>In September, 1846, the death of Thomas Clarkson, at the age
of eighty-six, recalled attention to the subjects of slavery and the slave
trade, against both of which, for many years, his energies had been
directed. It was in 1720 that English opinion was first drawn to the
horrors incidental to that traffic. In 1787, by the efforts of Clarkson<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_54" id="Page_54">54</a></span>
and Granville Sharp, a Society for total abolition of the system was
formed. In the following year a Committee of the House of Commons
was appointed to inquire into the entire system; but not for a considerable
time could the objects of that Society be carried out, or members
of influence be induced to take interest in the Anti-Slavery Association
and its work. Suddenly, and as if through an accidental occurrence,
public opinion was aroused; that accident, the seizure in the streets of
London of an escaped slave, named Somerset&mdash;&#8203;his late master, the
captor. In 1792, Wilberforce carried a Bill for the gradual abolition
of the slave trade. In 1805 the importation of slaves into British
Colonies, recently taken from Holland, was prohibited; a Bill carried,
by which such traffic after 1808 was declared illegal. In 1811 it was
declared to be felony; in 1824 it was made piracy. In 1837, made
punishable by transportation for life. In 1838, complete emancipation
of slaves throughout all British possessions took place. We were soon
to see the results of those measures in what had once been one of
slavery’s most active spheres.</p>

<p class="drop-cap3"><span class="smcap1">Cold</span>, misty, and raw was the day in the first week of January, 1847,
when, at Gravesend, a small party, of which I was one, embarked
on the brig <i>Emily</i>, bound to Cape Coast Castle. Still more miserable
the four following days and nights, during which the little vessel
remained at anchor, a thick dark fog enveloping us; horns and gongs
sounding at intervals, to avert a collision, if possible. At last the pall
lifted, and we were on our way. My fellow-passengers, four in number,
were three junior officers of the 1st West India Regiment, and the wife
of one of them. The ship had a burthen of only 130 tons; no
separate cabins, no accommodation suitable for officers, and none
whatever for a lady. Around the cuddy, as the “saloon” was
called, a series of bunks were arranged; one of these was told off
to each of us, ingress being attained either feet or head foremost,
according to individual fancy and agility. Every possible consideration
was shown by all on board to the lady, whose sorry plight we all
commiserated; hers was indeed a sad example of the discomforts
to which a subaltern’s wife was exposed. Our prospects so far were by
no means happy, for the circumstance became increasingly plain that
only “black sheep” were considered to be sent to “the Coast”;
many years had to elapse before Africa was to spring into fashion.</p>

<p>Fifty-two days at sea&mdash;&#8203;for steam communication with the West Coast<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_56" id="Page_56">56</a></span>
was a thing of the future&mdash;&#8203;and then the headland of Grand Drewin
came in sight. That point sighted, our little ship glided along the
coast, carried southward by the oceanic current at the rate of three
knots an hour or thereabouts. Arrived in the roads of Elmina, at the
time a Dutch settlement, we disembarked by means of small canoes,
made by hollowing out a branch of the bombax or silk cotton tree,
each canoe “manned” by three black boys, the eldest of whom did
not apparently exceed twelve years of age. We made direct for the
house of Mr. Bartels, not that we had an introduction to that well-known
gentleman, but for the double reason that “everybody” did so,
and that Elmina boasted neither of hotel nor other public place to
which new arrivals could resort. The hospitable gentleman on whom
we had thus thrown ourselves showed us every kindness. Next day
means of conveyance to our destination were provided for us. Mine
consisted of a long narrow basket, carried on the heads of two strong
Africans, one at either end. In that way we travelled over some miles
of roadless ground; in others along the sea beach left dry by the
receded tide, and so arrived at Cape Coast Castle, the capital of our
settlements on the Coast of <span class="locked">Guinea.<a name="FNanchor_74" id="FNanchor_74" href="#Footnote_74" class="fnanchor">74</a></span></p>

<p>The fortress had in its day been used for many purposes, from the
time when in 1610 it was erected by the Portuguese, and by them made
use of as a slave hold, down to the present (1847). Captured by the
Dutch from its original possessors in 1643, it was taken from the latter
by Admiral Holmes in 1661; recaptured by the Dutch fleet under De
Ruyter in 1665, but the same year ceded to England. In 1757 it was
attacked unsuccessfully by the French, since which it has remained free
from the din of war, although from time to time conflicts have occurred
between the native tribes occupying the neighbouring districts. In
1672 the first African Company received a charter from Charles II.
From that date till 1844 the fort continued in the possession of that
Company and its successors; in the year named it came directly under
the administration of the Colonial Office, as a dependency of Sierra
Leone. At the time of our sojourn there, Cape Coast Castle was
occupied by a portion of a West India regiment by officers belonging
thereto, and to military departments; by the Governor, also by the
“mixed court,” by which law or justice, or both, were administered. A
school for African children, the apartment being used for Divine service<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_57" id="Page_57">57</a></span>
on Sundays, was in close proximity to the billiard-room. An annexe of
the fort was utilised as a prison for the worst class of malefactors, and
the native police in charge of them, the prisoners being engaged in
chain gangs by day, working on roads and public works within the
settlement. Since the days of slavery, what had been “barracoons” for
captives have been transformed into water tanks for the supply abundantly
provided by the rainy season.</p>

<p>The inhabitants of the territory around Cape Coast Castle and of the
Gold Coast generally are in the mass known as Fantees. Originally
dwellers in the regions beyond the river Prah, they were forced to cross
it, and driven to the coast line by the people now called Ashantees, who
took possession of and gave their name to the country so conquered.
Although under protection of the British Government, the Fantee
chiefs (in 1847) pay tribute to the Ashantee king, who still assumes
suzerainty over them. That suzerainty, since 1826, has been maintained
without right on their part, the Ashantees having in that year
been defeated at Doodwa, near Accra, by a Fantee force, led by
British officers. In the same year, however, though earlier in it, a
small <span class="locked">force,<a name="FNanchor_75" id="FNanchor_75" href="#Footnote_75" class="fnanchor">75</a></span> under Sir Charles Macarthy, was disastrously beaten by
the Ashantees. That officer, rather than fall alive into the hands of his
enemies, is said to have shot himself; they to have devoured his heart,
in the belief that by that act of cannibalism they might become endowed
with the high attributes which they admired in him.</p>

<p>A noticeable characteristic of the people was the total absence among
them of ceremony, rite, or other observance pertaining to religious
worship. That certain phases of superstitious impressions existed among
them was evident by their belief in “lucky” and “unlucky” days.
Neither a fisherman nor bushman would proceed on their avocations on
a Friday, as it was by them devoted to their <span class="locked">“Fetish.”<a name="FNanchor_76" id="FNanchor_76" href="#Footnote_76" class="fnanchor">76</a></span> Although caste
as understood in India is unknown among Fantees, the existence of
septs or families approaches in some respects the social and religious
divisions of the Hindoos. Each Fantee sept is distinguished by its
special badge or armorial bearing, taken usually from some wild animal
of the forest, as among Scottish Highlanders and other civilized
nations, ancient and modern.</p>

<p>Ten years had nearly elapsed since slavery on the Gold Coast, as in
all other British dominions, was abolished. In all but name conditions
remained unchanged; former domestic slaves, now called servants, remained
with their former owners, by whom they were housed, clothed,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_58" id="Page_58">58</a></span>
and fed as heretofore. It was related that when, in <span class="locked">1838,<a name="FNanchor_77" id="FNanchor_77" href="#Footnote_77" class="fnanchor">77</a></span> emancipation
was proclaimed, the negroes here appealed against being “sent
away,” on the plea that they and their children had ever been cared
for; that as freed men and women they were without country to return
to, or means of earning their living, save with their old masters and
mistresses. Their appeal was listened to, and now (1847), when asked
jokingly, rather than in earnest, to whom do they belong, they answer
proudly that they are “slave” of, say Mrs. Jackson, Mr. Barnes, Mr.
Hutton, and so on, all highly respected residents of Cape Coast.</p>

<p>A “slave” girl of the class alluded to having died, ceremonies,
elaborate in kind, took place over her body. Placed in a sitting
posture, and so supported in a corner of a room, it was enveloped in a
shroud of costly damask; the feet rested upon a cushion similarly
covered; neck and arms decorated with heavy ornaments of solid gold;
the body embellished by more or less artistic designs composed of gold
dust applied to some adhesive material. In the mouth was a twig of
shrub; on an adjoining table a goodly supply of rum and tobacco. On
the floor of the room sat a crowd of female mourners, whose dirge was
loud if not melodious. These ceremonies over, the dead, still covered
with ornaments, was deposited in the grave prepared for it in the floor
of the dwelling-house of the survivors; but, as stated to us, at the end
of a year, the body would be “turned on its side to make it comfortable,”
and then the golden ornaments removed.</p>

<p>Two months had elapsed since our arrival, and impressions of the
place were noted after this manner:&mdash;&#8203;At the end of February, temperature
in the shade between the moderate extremes of 84° F. and 86° F.;
sky clear and cloudless, sea breeze recurring each morning, and continuing
during the hours of daylight. Behind, and from close proximity
to the town, the “bush” or dense forest begins; two inconsiderable
hills, each surmounted by a “fort,” dominate us. Some few roads or
pathways extend in various directions inland and along the beach side
to the Salt Pond, their borders lined with cacti and with flowering
<span class="locked">shrubs,<a name="FNanchor_78" id="FNanchor_78" href="#Footnote_78" class="fnanchor">78</a></span> the occurrence of reptiles of various kinds, and creeping things
innumerable, adding to our walks of interest and excitement in giving
the former chase. Among the forest trees a species of bombax was a
striking object, its branches so thickly covered with nests of the tailor-bird
(<i>Ploceus</i>) that they touched each other, and looked not unlike a
series of gigantic honeycombs. The absence of the bamboo was noted
with surprise, considering the latitude of the locality. Nor was any<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_59" id="Page_59">59</a></span>
cultivated field to be seen, the explanation being that each year small
patches of the bush are cut down, the ground cleared, crops sown or
planted, and once gathered in the “field” is quickly restored to its
original wild state till again required for agricultural purposes. Birds
and butterflies, some of both highly coloured, dashed through or fluttered
among the herbage, but no voice of song properly so called as yet
came from the former.</p>

<p>With the advent of the tornado season, the face of nature underwent
a sudden change. From the south-east came rapidly a mass of dense
black cloud. As it seemed arrested overhead, it assumed the form of an
arch; from its concavity forked lightning flashed, then heavy thunder
rolled. The previous stillness gave place to a rush of wind at hurricane
speed, followed by such a downfall of rain as we had never previously
seen, even in India. A few repetitions of these, and the rainy season
was upon us. Then suddenly cultivation was begun in places previously
covered by bush; crops of Indian corn, yams (<i>Convolvulus
Batatas</i>), ground-nuts (<i>Arachis hypogea</i>), and the castor-oil plant sprang
up with a rapidity truly astonishing.</p>

<p>With the first regular downpour of rain came a serious change in
health of our small party within the fort, also of the few settlers
whose places of business were in the town immediately outside; and
for a few succeeding months we were destined to realize the true significance
of a sickly season on the Coast of Guinea. Fever in one or
other of its local forms made its appearance, affecting the older residents
in that of ague, while the newly arrived were attacked by the
more violent form, called at the time their “seasoning,” from which the
chances of recovery were considerably less than those of death. Of
the three officers and the wife of one who had been my fellow-passengers,
one of the former speedily succumbed. The other two, together
with the lady, suffered severely, and made imperfect recoveries,
while outside the fort conditions were no less serious. The blanks so
made in our numbers were sadly apparent, and yet the survivors from
attacks, and those who had not been struck down, found in each successive
death this rather ghastly consolation, that, as the ratio of mortality
was “being made up,” so did their chances of escape increase. All
this while the few of us who were capable of the exertion took our
walk morning and evening when the weather permitted, our one
promenade that towards “the Salt Pond.” As we did so, the melancholy
sight presented itself, of a small number of newly arrived <span class="locked">missionaries<a name="FNanchor_79" id="FNanchor_79" href="#Footnote_79" class="fnanchor">79</a></span>
gloomily pursuing the same route, “waiting,” as we were<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_60" id="Page_60">60</a></span>
informed, “for their seasoning,” before being sent inland to their respective
stations. One after another was missed; it was announced that
“he was down with his seasoning”; and then&mdash;&#8203;the receipt of a black-edged
envelope told the rest.</p>

<p>Meantime I retained my health to a degree that under the circumstances
was remarkable. As a result of this happy exemption from
sickness, various duties devolved upon me in addition to those within
my proper sphere, among those extra responsibilities being professional
work in the Colonial Hospital, and charge of the Commissariat Department
for the troops&mdash;&#8203;the latter altogether alien to my training or tastes.
So conditions went on till July, a month which proved to be the most
unhealthy and deadly of any throughout the year. It was then that,
night after night, I was the solitary member of “our mess” who took
his place at table. I made the acquaintance of, and speedily became
on friendly terms with, some mice, whose place of residence was under
the floor, but which freely communicated with the messroom by numerous
apertures, and was in other respects dilapidated; nor did it take long
before some of the little animals acquired sufficient confidence to
scramble up my leg and so on to the table, partake of dinner with myself,
thus calling to my mind the story of the Prisoner of Chillon. With
the month of August came improved health conditions, and for the four
or five succeeding months all was cheerful in that particular and important
respect.</p>

<p>Among those who succumbed during the sickly months was Captain
Maclean, husband of the poetess, L. E. L.&mdash;&#8203;Letitia Elizabeth Landon,
who died at Cape Coast Castle in 1838, under circumstances of great
mystery. It was hoped that among his papers would be found some
containing his own account of the sad occurrence, but that hope was
not realized. From careful inquiries, however, I was led to the belief
that her death was due to natural causes, and to them alone. Now the
body of the deceased husband was laid in the grave close to that of the
<span class="locked">wife,<a name="FNanchor_80" id="FNanchor_80" href="#Footnote_80" class="fnanchor">80</a></span> and both rest under the pavement of the castle quadrangle. The
story of the gifted lady interested some of our number, as incidents
connected with her short life on the Coast were related by Mr. Hutton
and others who had enjoyed her acquaintance.</p>

<p>The occurrence of the “healthy season” was hailed as such event
could only be in a locality where every man had to run the gauntlet
for life during four to five out of the twelve months which make up the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_61" id="Page_61">61</a></span>
year. Amusements of different kinds were instituted, short excursions
taken in various directions along such roads or pathways as existed for
purposes of communication along the coast and to places inland. In
the absence of horses&mdash;&#8203;for these most useful animals when brought to
the coast rapidly pine away and die&mdash;&#8203;our means of transport consisted,
for the most part, of a chair so placed between two poles as to
be thus carried by two or four Africans, according to the weight of the
individual. There were a few small light carriages, in some respects
like a Bath chair, in others like a victoria, drawn by Africans, who, to
judge by their antics and shouts as they raced against each other, must
have enjoyed the work immensely. Picnics became “the order of the
day”; Saints’ days, birthdays, and holidays were most “religiously”
kept, and for the most part very enthusiastically celebrated. On one
of these occasions we visited what at one time had been a coffee
plantation in the near vicinity, but then deserted; the buildings reduced
to ruin, the coffee bushes choked by the ordinary bush, the natural
impression being that the owner had fallen a victim to his “seasoning,”
that he had no successors on his <span class="locked">estate;<a name="FNanchor_81" id="FNanchor_81" href="#Footnote_81" class="fnanchor">81</a></span> or, if he had, that they had
also succumbed.</p>

<p>Pursuits relating to natural history became so many sources of
pleasant and intellectual occupation. Ornithology was especially
interesting, combining as it did observation of birds in their natural
haunts and conditions. A large number of specimens were shot, one
portion being subsequently given to the Natural History Museum of
Edinburgh, another to Sir William Jardine, by whom notes taken at
the time were <span class="locked">published.<a name="FNanchor_82" id="FNanchor_82" href="#Footnote_82" class="fnanchor">82</a></span> A song bird (<i>Drymoica mentalis</i>) that fell
to my gun was for the first time, I believe, given as an illustration in
that brochure; another illustration being that of a large and handsome
swallow named after me, <i>Hirundo Gordoni</i>.</p>

<p>On one occasion, while combining ornithological study and “sport,”
I had an unpleasant experience with one of several kinds of poisonous
snakes that here abound, frequenting chiefly prickly herbage in immediate
proximity to such roads and pathways as then existed, as also the
sedgy tract of open ground near the Salt Pond, a little way westward
of the settlement. While traversing that tract I came suddenly face
to face with a large black cobra. One barrel of my fowling-piece
had been already discharged. The remaining shot&mdash;&#8203;a mixture
of Nos. 6 and 9&mdash;&#8203;was fired, more as a result of instinctive action than
steady aim, by me, but with good effect. The charge traversed the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_62" id="Page_62">62</a></span>
body of the reptile as if it were a bullet, so close was it to me; then
its writhings were such that I came within them, not a little to my own
horror. In the emergency my Fantee “boy” speedily dispatched it by
means of the heavy stick he carried for the purpose of beating the bush.
The skin&mdash;&#8203;considerably over six feet long&mdash;&#8203;ornamented the wall of
my barrack-room while I remained on the coast. Puff-adders are
numerous, and from their sluggish movements are easily killed. On
one occasion I killed six partially-grown individuals during a morning’s
walk on the Salt Pond road.</p>

<p>When, as already stated, administration of British settlements on the
Gold Coast was taken over by the Colonial Office, it was made immediately
subordinate to that of Sierra Leone. The inconvenience of
that arrangement was soon made manifest. The force with which the
oceanic current runs southward along the coast is sufficient during some
months of the year to prevent sailing brigs from beating up against it;
and as at the time alluded to a regular line of steamers had not been
introduced, the outcome of that state of things was the inconvenient
necessity of letters and dispatches for the headquarters of the
Government and Command being sent <i>viâ</i> England, several months
becoming thus necessary before answers could be received. Cape
Coast Castle and its dependencies had a Governor and Colonial
Secretary, both of whom were resident. Justice was administered by
a court presided over by a British official designated Judicial Assessor,
assisted by selected native chiefs. Of them, “King Aggary,” then
upwards of eighty years of age, was the most prominent and distinguished.
As a young man he had served on board a British man-of-war,
in accordance with the custom of the time, and so, according to
his own manner of expression, he “had learned sense.”</p>

<p>For a long time past native rulers whose “kingdoms” adjoined
British settlements along the Gold Coast had voluntarily placed themselves
under protection of our flag, and thus in a manner become
British subjects. Their several laws and customs were retained, with
the exception of human sacrifice, a practice abandoned many years ago.
Succession to rank and property descended through the female line;
that is, the eldest son of the eldest daughter became heir-apparent.
In the kingdom of Akim the sovereign is a female, the succession being
also in the female line.</p>

<p>A visit to Accra occupied two days, and a similar time to return.
The path along which I travelled&mdash;&#8203;for no road existed&mdash;&#8203;led for the most
part through the bush close to the beach; at times it was by the beach
itself, so that only when the tide was low was it practicable to proceed
at all. At intervals the occurrence of rugged promontories and heaps<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_63" id="Page_63">63</a></span>
of boulders rendered it by no means an easy undertaking to get over
them. Arriving at the river Sekoom, its borders were lined by mangrove
trees (<i>Rhizophora</i>), the long tendril-like roots of which interlaced
above the soft mud alternately covered and left exposed as the tide
flows and ebbs. In some places the trunks of those trees were covered
within tide mark by a small species of oyster, and presented the
additional peculiarity of a few small fish&mdash;&#8203;the climbing perch (<i>Anabas
scandens</i>) laboriously ascending to the height of a couple of feet or so
from the water level, there “holding on” for a little, then dropping
into the muddy river after basking in the sun. At Accra, three forts,
belonging respectively to England, Holland, and Denmark, were in close
proximity to each other: the first occupied by some twenty black
soldiers and half a dozen native militiamen, the guns old and useless,
the fortress itself dilapidated; the second nothing more than a
trading store of the Governor; the third, the strongest of the three,
but noted for its extreme unhealthiness. Subsequently we learned that
it was completely destroyed by an earthquake.</p>

<p>Several of the forts that had belonged to the former African Company
were abandoned some years previous to the present date (1848);
among others that of Amelycha, or Apollonia, about seventy miles to
windward of Cape Coast Castle. For a time matters in the district so
called progressed very well under the rule of a humane and otherwise
good native chief named Yansu Acko; but having died in 1830, he
was succeeded by Quako Acko, a man of cruel and tyrannical disposition,
who, although he continued to fly the British flag, gradually
became less and less loyal, and finally withdrew allegiance altogether.
Meanwhile he was in a continual state of warfare with the States adjoining
his own, extending his depredations to Asinee and Axim, respectively
belonging to France and Holland. In 1835 his conduct had
become so outrageous that a force from Cape Coast Castle was sent
against him, and for his misconduct he was subjected to a fine of 300
ounces of gold dust. So little effect had this upon him, however,
that in 1838 a second expedition was sent against him, and a further
fine of 800 ounces inflicted upon him. From that time to the present
he has persisted in annoying the adjoining States. Within his own
“kingdom” his word was absolute, his great ambition apparently to
surround his palace with festoons composed of skulls of enemies slain
in battle or of captives butchered. With increasing boldness as time
went on, he destroyed several villages within Dutch territory, and carried
away some of their inhabitants. He maltreated officers and men
belonging to French and British ships, who landed at his capital for
purposes of trade. Finally, when remonstrated with by the Governor<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_64" id="Page_64">64</a></span>
of Cape <span class="locked">Coast,<a name="FNanchor_83" id="FNanchor_83" href="#Footnote_83" class="fnanchor">83</a></span> he insulted and otherwise maltreated the members
of the embassy sent to him, certain of whom he retained as
captives. The Governor took action against the recalcitrant chief.
Orders were issued directing the formation of a contingent force, some
thousands strong, to consist of men pertaining to vassal tribes. A brig
was chartered for the occasion; ammunition and stores of various kinds,
including casks of fresh water, placed on board; for it was known
that the scene of coming operations was destitute of that necessary
element. Ammunition was issued to the “volunteer” contingent, to
whom pay in advance was distributed. At this point the <span class="locked">officer<a name="FNanchor_84" id="FNanchor_84" href="#Footnote_84" class="fnanchor">84</a></span>
named to command fell ill and speedily died of coast fever, and his
place had to be taken by a <span class="locked">lieutenant<a name="FNanchor_85" id="FNanchor_85" href="#Footnote_85" class="fnanchor">85</a></span> of the 1st West India Regiment;
the Commissariat <span class="locked">officer<a name="FNanchor_86" id="FNanchor_86" href="#Footnote_86" class="fnanchor">86</a></span> being non-effective from sickness, the duties
pertaining to his office fell upon me in addition to my own.</p>

<p>The resources of the colony in respect to white men limited the
number of those available for the present expedition to six only, the
“regular” troops to no more than about half a company of the 1st West
India Regiment. Four of us by <span class="locked">ship;<a name="FNanchor_87" id="FNanchor_87" href="#Footnote_87" class="fnanchor">87</a></span> two accompanied the levies
proceeding by land, their forces increasing as they advanced. Arrived
off Dixcove, we landed at that place, to witness the native ceremony,
and excitement attending thereon, of “burying the peace-drum.” The
unusual noise and tumult connected with the ordeal seem to have
attracted the notice of wild denizens of the adjoining forest, one of
which, a baboon of large size, “assisted” with his presence on the
occasion; he was declared to be “the great Fetish”; his advent to be
a happy augury for the undertaking before us. Our next point was
Axim, at that time Dutch, but now British. There we landed; there
the entire force at our disposal assembled, and arrangements were
completed to enter hostile territory. The small party of whites was
accommodated within the fort, the native forces bivouacking in and
around the town,&mdash;&#8203;the town consisting chiefly of sheds or huts composed
of palm branches inartistically tied together. In the open space or
market place in its centre stood a pole to which were fixed portions of
human skeletons, remains of freebooters from Apollonia, who having
been caught were “disposed of” according to African fashion. In the
vicinity roads were non-existent; some rugged pathways were all the
thoroughfares with which the place was provided.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_65" id="Page_65">65</a></span>
Between Axim and the river Encobra stretched a sea beach two miles
in extent, broken at intervals by irregular masses and boulders of
primitive rocks; beyond it to a similar distance a belt of impenetrable
forest, pathways through which, formerly existing, had for some years
past become obliterated. Through that tract of bush we had to make
a way, not only for ourselves, but also for our “forces.” Armed with
an axe and long knife such as bush men in this part of Africa use,
we cut a path for ourselves to the summit of a promontory from which
it was practicable to take bearings for further progress. Meanwhile, and
all through the following night, large numbers of men were busy clearing
a road by which the mass of our contingent could advance. At
daybreak our strange body of irregulars was mustered, and what a sight
it presented! War dresses, wild in character, grotesque in aspect;
umbrellas of many colours, carried over particular chiefs; uncouth
gesticulations in the performance of war dances; strange sounds from
drums, horns, trumpets, and other “musical” instruments, the chief
ornaments on which were jawbones and other fragments of human
mortality, combined to impress us with the aspect of savagery so
presented. At the head of one of the “companies,” and in command,
was a lady, who thus asserted her hereditary position as chief of her
tribe.</p>

<p>In the early hours of a day in the first week of April (1848), our
“army” began its march towards the left bank of the Encobra. By
previous arrangement a number of canoes, sufficient to take the force
across that river, were already outside the bar at its mouth, and these
were quickly utilised for our purpose. A dense mass of natives
crowded the opposite side of the river, its dimensions quickly increasing
as others emerged from the bush. Our “artillery” consisted
of two twelve-pounder rocket tubes, and two others of smaller calibre.
In the absence of a “combatant” officer, I had been put in “command”
of these, and having previously indulged in the necessary practice, was
in a position to open fire upon the “enemy” as soon as the necessary
order was given by the Governor, who was in supreme command. A few
missiles were discharged; a few lanes ploughed among them, and then
pell-mell the mass vanished in the forest. Having got across the river,
we speedily reached an Apollonian village, deserted by its ordinary
occupants, who in their haste had left behind their flocks and herds,
both of which were quickly annexed by our “contingent.” Continuing
what proved to be an extremely fatiguing march along the sea beach,&mdash;&#8203;often
having to wade more than knee-deep in the rippling tide,&mdash;&#8203;we
passed on the border of the forest a succession of villages, from all
of which their occupants had fled. Towards evening we reached a<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_66" id="Page_66">66</a></span>
town of considerable size. Our day’s march had been extremely exhausting,
so that rest for the night was most welcome, especially to us
white men.</p>

<p>In the course of the succeeding night, such snatches of sleep as we
obtained were several times interrupted by the beating of tom-toms,
braying of trumpets, the rushing hither and thither of considerable
portions of our army. Now it was an alarm of night attack by “the
enemy”; then the noisy return of a foraging party, bearing with
them as trophies the heads of two Apollonians, which they cast before
the Governor as tokens of their prowess. Resuming our march early
the following morning, we arrived at the river Abimoosoo, across which
we were floated by means of canoes that had so far followed by sea,
keeping just outside the line of breakers. Shortly thereafter we were
met by a messenger from “the king” against whom we were in progress;
his office to express the desire of his Majesty to know with
what object the Governor had brought an army into his country. The
reply was a ball cartridge (according to the custom of the coast),
together with a reply that if the king surrendered, then “a palaver”
would be held, but not till then. Meantime we pressed on, and in the
early part of the afternoon entered the capital of the king, to find it
completely abandoned. Never before had I felt so “done up” and
exhausted as now. I was, moreover, ill, and had every reason to believe
that an attack of the much-dreaded fever of the coast was upon me.</p>

<p>As if to celebrate the entry of our “army” into the royal city,
arrangements were speedily made by the native leaders to have a grand
procession. When it did take place, no more wild and “savage”
display could well be imagined than that presented by it. All around
us were ghastly relics of death and murder. The palace garnished
with festoons of human skulls, of which I counted one hundred and
eighty after the greater part of such ornaments had been torn from
their places and kicked about as playthings by our “soldiers.” The
avenue leading to the palace was formed by palm-trees growing at
short distances from each other along either side of the roadway.
From time to time the king had disposed of a certain number of his
enemies by living sepulture in a standing position; a cocoa nut placed
on the head of each, the earth thrown in, and as in the progress of
time the plume of palm grew higher and higher, each tree received the
name of the particular enemy represented by it. At different points
around, the larger trees were ornamented with various relics of
humanity, skeleton hands and other fragments being nailed or otherwise
attached to stems and branches.</p>

<p>During the few following days different portions of our contingent<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_67" id="Page_67">67</a></span>
were variously employed. An expedition, led by two of our white
<span class="locked">associates,<a name="FNanchor_88" id="FNanchor_88" href="#Footnote_88" class="fnanchor">88</a></span> started inland, with a view, if possible, to capture the fugitive
king; another, consisting entirely of blacks, having started independently
into the bush, returned in triumph, with “music,” war dances,
and much discordant noise, bearing with them gory heads of three
Apollonians who had fallen into their power. A third party of our people,
having proceeded on an independent expedition, came upon two men
who had been made prisoners by order of that chief, each of them
laden with three sets of heavy irons, which they had worn continuously
during the two previous years. The manacles were removed after much
labour; but their unhappy bearers, when relieved of them, were unable
to stand erect. So long had they been kept in a sitting posture by sheer
weight of their fetters, that the joints had become accommodated to it.
Shortly afterwards eighty-eight other prisoners were discovered, their
fetters similarly removed, but they themselves fixed in the sitting posture
to which they had for longer or shorter periods been borne down by
iron manacles.</p>

<p>Everywhere around the town the bush was impenetrable, for all
communication with neighbouring tribes had been cut off for some
years past, the pathways thus become obliterated by the forest. Attempts
to cut new ones were but partially successful. Meanwhile serious
difficulties beset us in respect to water, for the lagoons and rivers
within available distance being brackish, they quickly ceased to be
resorted to. A few casks of fresh water from our chartered ship thrown
overboard were washed ashore, their contents carefully distributed
among ourselves; but the fact became very evident that this supply
being extremely limited, our “occupation” of the town must be short
indeed, whether the object of our expedition was obtained or not.</p>

<p>Most fortunate for us there was treason in the king’s camp. By
reason of his cruelty and tyranny, he had rendered himself hated by
and hateful to his subjects. Now their opportunity had arrived. Three
of their chiefs having tendered their submission, so far imitated certain
civilized nations as to negotiate for the surrender of their king&mdash;&#8203;their
terms by no means exorbitant, namely one hundred ounces of gold
dust, and a flag to them respectively. And so the bargain was
closed.</p>

<p>A few more days passed, during which “palavers” of all sorts took
place, and parties dispatched in various directions, though seemingly
without result. Evening approaches; there is unusual tumult among
our contingent. Discordant noises, emitted from drums, horns, and<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_68" id="Page_68">68</a></span>
human mouths, announce the approach of large bodies of men; they
are the former subjects of the <span class="locked">king,<a name="FNanchor_89" id="FNanchor_89" href="#Footnote_89" class="fnanchor">89</a></span> whom they carry manacled and
give over to the British leader. We feel relieved by the prospect of
speedy ending of our privations and fatigues; for of our number, four
are prostrate by sickness. So long as our prisoner, savage as he is,
continued out of sight, we did our best to follow him up relentlessly.
Now that he is in our presence, bound hand and foot, an object of
abject misery, big tears rolling down his coarse black face, some of us
were unable to smother a shade of sympathy for the man, monster
of cruelty as he was.</p>

<p>Of atrocities committed by him the record of two will here suffice.
He caused his mother to be secured to a stake at low-water mark
when the tide was out, her eyelids to be cut off, her face turned
towards the sun,&mdash;&#8203;so left until overwhelmed by the returning
flood, and her sufferings put an end to. His pregnant sister he
caused to be cut open while alive, that he might see the position in
her womb of the unborn infant, then directed that according to native
custom her body should be buried within the palace.</p>

<p>In the room under the floor of which the remains were interred,
bearing upon them her golden ornaments, the captive king was placed
under guard, and so remained during the following night. With
the return of daylight it was seen that the floor had been opened
by the guard, the remains exhumed, all ornaments wrenched therefrom;
the body itself, considerably advanced in decay, offensive to
sight and smell, thrown back into the still open grave. Thus the king
had spent the night side by side as it were with the remains of his
murdered sister, witness to the acts of savagery to which they were
subjected.</p>

<p>Our object attained, the return march began at midnight; our
prisoner, several of his wives, together with other members of his
family, being under the charge of a strong guard. The four sick white
men, unable to take their proper places in the ranks, were carried,
country fashion, in the long baskets already described, our bearers
being subjects of the king whom we were carrying away prisoner.
Again the beach, left dry by the receded tide, was our highway, and
along it our “brave” men proceeded. How the sick fared is
illustrated in my own experience. As the fierce tropical sun ascended
in the heavens, the fever from which I suffered increased, headache
was severe; fresh water there was none wherewith to moisten the
parched mouth. In this plight, having by signs indicated my desire<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_69" id="Page_69">69</a></span>
that my basket should be placed on the ground, I endeavoured to make
my way to the ripples left by the recurring waves; but in so doing
strength gave way, and I fell prostrate on the sand. Immediately I
found myself being gently lifted back to the basket by my carriers.
One of them climbing a cocoa-nut tree that grew in our immediate
vicinity, cut off a large specimen of its fruit, which was speedily opened
by a companion beside me, its “milk” emptied over my face and
given me to drink. At the time and often since I have thought
gratefully of that act by the wild African, and have contrasted it with
its counterpart met with among “civilized” peoples.</p>

<p>Arrived at Axim, and the necessary arrangements completed, we
re-embarked on the little brig that had already done good service in
connection with our expedition. The captive chief, or “king” as he
was called, was speedily on board, under the care of a guard, the
anchor raised. Wind and current favoured us, and so we quickly
arrived off Cape Coast. In the early hours of morning we landed.
Our prisoner was securely placed in a cell of that fortress. The
populace of the native town, on hearing the news, were in great commotion;
our friends, merchants and others, from whom we had parted
a month before, were full of congratulations. Then followed invitations
to dinner, picnics, and so forth, until the rainy season, already
threatening, fairly broke upon us and put a stop to all.</p>

<p>Among other characteristic incidents related to us was that, as soon
as our expedition had marched away, the women of Cape Coast, omitting
the slight costume usually worn by them, went about their ordinary
occupations in a state of nudity. One of the oldest of the foreign
residents, astonished at the circumstance, inquired as to the reason
for such an extraordinary proceeding; he received as answer from
the perambulating statue so addressed the Fantee equivalent of
“What does it matter? All the <i>men</i> have started for the war,”
much emphasis being given to the word “men.”</p>

<p>The work of paying up and disbanding the contingent portion of the
force was quickly carried out. In the former, gold dust was the
currency employed, of which the equivalent value of three-halfpence
was the daily rate given, no allowance being required for food. Years
passed away, and then I learned that the wretched king, having lost
his reason in his confinement, pined away, and died a drivelling
idiot in his prison. One by one our party of white men engaged
in this small but extremely trying piece of service dropped away, and
for many years before the time when the present notes are transferred
to these pages I have been the sole survivor. The expedition was
mentioned approvingly in the <i>Times</i> some months after it had become<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_70" id="Page_70">70</a></span>
a thing of the past. Medals and decorations for similar services in
West Africa were then in the future.</p>

<p>Fifteen months on the Gold Coast; then came the welcome news
that a ship with “reliefs” on board was sighted. Great was the
excitement as we watched her gradual approach; great the zest with
which their arrival was welcomed; hospitable the reception accorded
to them; great the marks of kindness in various ways shown to us by
residents. It was long since news had reached us from England, for
regular mail communication did not exist. Papers now received were
eagerly read, for they were filled with details illustrative of a threatening
political aspect in various kingdoms of Europe.</p>

<p>Taught by experience how treacherous and dangerous was the
climate of Cape Coast, I determined to proceed by the first ship to sail,
irrespective of immediate destination, the chief object being “to get
away.” The arrival of the transport <i>Baretto Junior</i>, with reliefs of
West Indian soldiers and African recruits for regiments in the West
Indies, afforded me the desired opportunity. On 24th of May we
embarked, the ship dropped with the current to Accra, and then
sailed for Barbados.</p>

<p>Glad and thankful to have successfully run the gauntlet as it were
against the climate of Guinea, the clear sea air, notwithstanding its
temperature of 83° F., had its usual beneficial effect on health impaired
on the Coast. The transport in which we sailed had on board
three hundred Africans, of whom about one-half were soldiers, the
remainder recruits, that is, captured slaves, selected from among those
in the Adjudication <span class="locked">Yard<a name="FNanchor_90" id="FNanchor_90" href="#Footnote_90" class="fnanchor">90</a></span> at Sierra Leone, and duly “enlisted” into
West India regiments. A good many of the soldiers were accompanied
by their wives and children. Among the “recruits” was a very strong
athletic African named Kakungee, one of a cargo of slaves, the vessel
conveying whom had recently been captured by a British man-of-war.
A fellow-slave, but now “recruit,” gave information of the violent and
uncontrollable temper of Kakungee while on board the slave ship;
that on two occasions he had suddenly attacked fellow-slaves, killing
his victims before a rescue could be effected. With a view to guard
against similar occurrences on board the <i>Baretto Junior</i>, he having
speedily shown the violence of his disposition, he was secured to the
deck by means of a cask&mdash;&#8203;in one end of which was a hole sufficiently
large to let through his head, but not his shoulders&mdash;&#8203;being put over him
and cleated down. In that manner he was kept during the early part
of our voyage, food and liquids given to him, but his hands prevented<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_71" id="Page_71">71</a></span>
from being made use of for either purpose. His imploring requests to
be relieved, and promises of good behaviour, led to his release, and
being allowed to mix with his fellow-countrymen. Suddenly and
without provocation he attacked a comrade. A Yorruba man of great
physical strength came to the rescue; dealt the assailant such a blow
that he reeled to leeward, and striking his head against a stanchion,
lay insensible in the scupper. For nine days he remained in that
condition, notwithstanding means used for his restoration; at the end
of that time he died&mdash;&#8203;a victim to his own incorrigible violence.</p>

<p>Twenty-nine days from Accra, our ship lay at anchor in Carlisle Bay,
<span class="locked">Barbados.<a name="FNanchor_91" id="FNanchor_91" href="#Footnote_91" class="fnanchor">91</a></span> Proceeding on shore to make the usual official reports
to the military authorities, we gained particulars in regard to the widespread
revolutionary spirit through the nations of Europe; that in
London serious demonstrations were threatened. Unhappily we also
learned that an outbreak of yellow fever had occurred among the
troops occupying barracks on the Savannah; that among victims of the
disease were some medical officers. The upshot was that I was ordered
on shore for duty. That afternoon I “took over” the barrack-room
assigned to me, vacated very shortly before through death of its
occupant. Disinfection and other means of modern sanitation were
little if at all thought of in those days; nor, up to the present, close
upon half a century since the event, has the malady extended to me.</p>

<p>The general aspect of Barbados is at first sight very beautiful.
Approaching the island from the northward, it appears as a mass of rich
green vegetation, the border of sea grape <span class="locked">trees,<a name="FNanchor_92" id="FNanchor_92" href="#Footnote_92" class="fnanchor">92</a></span> like so many bearded
men,&mdash;&#8203;whence its name was taken,&mdash;&#8203;becoming more distinct as we
approach. Towards its interior a succession of hills rise to a height
of eight hundred or a thousand feet, their sides mostly covered with
turf, with here and there clumps of trees, the intervening valleys
divided by different estates and lots upon which are grown sugar-cane
and <span class="locked">guinea-corn.<a name="FNanchor_93" id="FNanchor_93" href="#Footnote_93" class="fnanchor">93</a></span> The houses have such a home-like look that the
name of “Little Scotland,” long since given to the island, seems appropriate,
more especially when the landscape is viewed from the summit
of one of those hills inland, to which in one of our excursions we proceeded.
Unhappily a check&mdash;&#8203;temporarily, it is hoped&mdash;&#8203;has been brought
upon the once flourishing sugar industry of the island. Since the
emancipation of slaves took place, properties have altogether fallen in
value, proprietors have been ruined, the universal complaint being that
the freed slaves cannot be got to work. Geologically the chief component
rocks of Barbados consist of coral limestone and coral. In<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_72" id="Page_72">72</a></span>
respect to its fauna, it has the peculiarity of possessing but a small
proportion of venomous snakes as compared with the other islands
of the West India group. The people who have been born on the
island are known as “Bims.” Their colour is a mixture of red and
albinoid white; their special characteristic said to be pride.</p>

<p>Comparing the climate of Barbados with that of tropical India, the
former has various advantages. To a certain extent it is bracing and
exhilarating; the prevailing breeze, as it comes across the Savannah,
pleasant to the sensations, so that officers and other persons ride out at
all hours of the day, their faces ruddy, themselves to all appearance in
robust health. At intervals of seven to eight years, epidemics of yellow
fever occur, such as that which recently attacked the 66th and 72nd
Regiments, and after a temporary decrease in its severity, recurred with
more than usual intensity and mortality. With regard to physical
conditions, geological and otherwise, there is to all appearance nothing
of a kind to supply explanation, whether of the advent, increase, temporary
cessation, sudden return with increased intensity, and final
cessation; neither can explanation be drawn from those conditions for
the lengthened duration of non-epidemic intervals, or of the cyclical
return of the disease in pestilential form.</p>

<p>Embarked on board the <i>Prince Royal</i> transport, I sailed for England.
During the homeward voyage only one incident deserving notice
occurred. In a clear moonlit night we became aware that we were
in collision with a vessel of no great size. As we rushed on deck, we
were shocked to observe that the craft suddenly disappeared a short
distance astern of us. No less to his own surprise than ours, a
sailor belonging to her was found on our deck, cast upon us in a
portion of her rigging that lay across it. He was carefully seen to
by us, taken to Portsmouth, and there handed over to the Spanish
Consul, for we had ascertained that the ship run down had sailed from
Corunna.</p>

<p>Gravesend reached, we disembarked; in due time reported our
arrival at Headquarters. The authorities granted the usual period
of leave of absence in accordance with Regulations at the time in force.
From them also I received a letter conveying the thanks of Earl Grey
for services performed in Africa. A few days thereafter I learned that
of our “reliefs,” three in number, two had died within a month after
landing at Cape Coast, one of them my own successor. Fortunate,
therefore, was my resolve not to delay departure.</p>

<p>Often is the statement made, but nearly always by persons who live
at home at ease, that deaths of British officers in Africa and other
tropical countries are due to their irregularities and vices, not to<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_73" id="Page_73">73</a></span>
combined conditions collectively constituting climate. The officers
with whom I was associated on the Gold Coast were in their habits and
general manner of life as nearly as possible like their contemporaries
in England; nor did the few who at times exceeded somewhat appear
to suffer in any respect more than did those of more temperate habits.
It is the climate of Guinea, and it alone, that kills the white man, and
in yet greater proportion the white woman.</p>

<p>An incident which occurred shortly after I had arrived in London was
in its way illustrative of the state of public feeling at the time. It was
while spending an evening in Portman Street <span class="locked">Barracks,<a name="FNanchor_94" id="FNanchor_94" href="#Footnote_94" class="fnanchor">94</a></span> then occupied
by the Scots Fusilier Guards, that orders from the Horse Guards
directed that the battalion should be kept within barracks and under
arms; information at the same time circulated that on the previous day
there had been a “rising” of the Chartists at Ashton, near Birmingham,
and that a similar outbreak in London was intended. Subsequently
we learned that the Duke of Wellington, then Commander-in-Chief, had
made ample arrangements for such a contingency, though with so much
secrecy and discretion that not a soldier was to be seen on the street.
But the anticipated outbreak did not take place.</p>

<p>A portion of leave granted was devoted by me to the combined
objects of restoring health and gaining knowledge. At the beginning
of the winter session I re-entered at Edinburgh University to benefit by
the lectures of Sir George Ballingall. Meanwhile, a <span class="locked">friend<a name="FNanchor_95" id="FNanchor_95" href="#Footnote_95" class="fnanchor">95</a></span> was interesting
himself in appropriate quarters in view to my being released from
further service on “the Coast.”</p>

<p class="drop-cap3"><span class="smcap1">Gazetted</span><a name="FNanchor_96" id="FNanchor_96" href="#Footnote_96" class="fnanchor">96</a> to the 57th, I joined that distinguished regiment at
Enniskillen, receiving from members of the “Die-hards” much
civility and courtesy as a new-comer among them. A few months passed,
and newspapers contained details of victory over the Sikhs at <span class="locked">Chilianwallah,<a name="FNanchor_97" id="FNanchor_97" href="#Footnote_97" class="fnanchor">97</a></span>
though at a British cost in killed and wounded of 89 officers
and 2,268 soldiers. With a sense of relief, intelligence by the following
mail was read that crushing defeat had been inflicted upon the enemy at
<span class="locked">Goojerat,<a name="FNanchor_98" id="FNanchor_98" href="#Footnote_98" class="fnanchor">98</a></span> though with a loss to our forces of 29 officers and 778 men;
the dispersion of the beaten army, the flight of their Affghan allies
towards the Khyber Pass&mdash;&#8203;for disaffection on the part of Dost Mahomed
had not yet been completely appeased.</p>

<p>During winter the weekly route march, with its attendant little incidents,
furnished about the only events of regimental life that need be alluded to.
As an outcome of what was looked upon as a scheme of “economical”
administration proposed for political reasons, a reduction in regimental
strength was ordered, several soldiers weeded out of the ranks in
accordance with orders received. Not long thereafter public attention
was drawn to “The Defenceless State of Great Britain” by Sir Francis
Head, to whose book, so named, credit was given for measures speedily
taken to reverse the schemes of reductions in <i>personnel</i> and <i>matériel</i>
alluded to.</p>

<p>With the return of summer the routine of regimental life became
again pleasant as compared with the monotony incidental to the dreary
months of winter. The leave season over, the process of preparing for<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_75" id="Page_75">75</a></span>
inspection seemed the only object for which the regiment existed, men
and officers lived; for no sooner was the dreaded ordeal past and over,
than the process was resumed for that which was to come six months
later on. As so many interludes, entertainments given and received,
games, and “matches” of various kinds became so frequent as to be
looked upon as somewhat monotonous.</p>

<p>Exceptional in these respects was the anniversary, on May 16, of
the battle of Albuhera in 1811, on which occasion the 57th Regiment
earned the soubriquet of “The <span class="locked">Die-hards,”<a name="FNanchor_99" id="FNanchor_99" href="#Footnote_99" class="fnanchor">99</a></span> of which it is so justly
proud, the <i>esprit de corps</i> maintained thereby as well as through anniversary
celebration being among its most valuable heritages. Then came
the birthday of Her Majesty; after it, the celebration of Waterloo, “the
credit of the regiment” being fully maintained on these occasions.</p>

<p>Trips in various directions by water and land proved to be most
enjoyable. Boating on the beautiful Loch Erne became a favourite
pastime, picnics on some of the many islands with which it is dotted
acquiring an interest of their own. Of those islands one <span class="locked">has<a name="FNanchor_100" id="FNanchor_100" href="#Footnote_100" class="fnanchor">100</a></span> a semi-sacred
character; upon it stand ruins of an ancient <span class="locked">church,<a name="FNanchor_101" id="FNanchor_101" href="#Footnote_101" class="fnanchor">101</a></span> and, as
believed, a still more ancient round tower. By road to <span class="locked">Beleek<a name="FNanchor_102" id="FNanchor_102" href="#Footnote_102" class="fnanchor">102</a></span> and
Ballyshannon was no less pleasant and interesting. Around the
promontory on which the first-named stands, the river Erne rushes as a
magnificent torrent; the second noted on account of its “salmon leap,”
and legendary story connected with the <span class="locked">islet<a name="FNanchor_103" id="FNanchor_103" href="#Footnote_103" class="fnanchor">103</a></span> at a little distance seaward
from the cataract. Extending our trip to Sligo, we visited the
ecclesiastical ruins and buildings pertaining to that city. In proximity
to one of them, several small heaps of human bones lay among the
grass, exposed to wind and weather. Inquiry elicited that they were
exhumed remains of dead prior to 1832, the great mortality by cholera
in that year rendering it necessary thus to “make room” for interment
of the numerous victims. But the necessity for leaving exposed the
vestiges of mortality was not apparent to us at the time.</p>

<p>At Bundoran I made the acquaintance of Lieutenant Monro, late of
the Blues, living in retirement, his prospects ruined as a result of the
duel into which he was forced with his brother-in-law, Lieut.-Colonel
Fawcett, 55th Regiment, whom he killed on that occasion. Coming<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_76" id="Page_76">76</a></span>
as that duel did not long after the “meeting” between Hawkey and
Seton, in which the latter received a wound that resulted in his death,
public opinion became aroused against the practice. Within two years
thereafter the Articles of War were so modified as to declare it to be
a military offence on the part of an officer to fight a duel or fail to take
measures to prevent one from taking place. For a considerable time
past there had been a growing feeling in the army and in civil life
against a system by which it was possible for the bully and the aggressor
to have an advantage as a “professed duellist” over the less experienced
adversary whom he might see fit to “call out.”</p>

<p>The celebration of the victory of the Boyne, July 1, 1690, and that of
Auchrim on 12th of the same month, 1691, was enthusiastically observed.
Processions of men, bedecked with the distinctive colour of their party,
led by bands of music and bearing with them a profusion of flags,
paraded the streets of Enniskillen. From many windows orange flags
and other party emblems were displayed; from the church steeple festoons
of orange-coloured ribbons waved in the breeze. In other respects
much of what was “demonstrative” in character took place, but the
general impression produced upon strangers and uninterested spectators
was not unlike that experienced as we looked in India upon
“religious” festivals.</p>

<p>The visit of Her Majesty to Ireland, and the prospect of a Levée
to take place in Dublin, attracted to that capital every officer whose
duties and position admitted of his being temporarily absent from
his regiment. The question of expediency of the Royal visit had for
some time previous been subject of conversation, nor was there an
absence of curiosity and anxiety in regard to the reception the Queen
might meet with on the occasion of her traversing the streets. Everywhere
it was enthusiastic, so much so that Her Majesty was much
impressed. The following day the Levée was held; some two thousand
presentations were made, and in the list of those who had that honour
my name was included.</p>

<p>At this time the general state of things in our immediate neighbourhood
was this:&mdash;&#8203;The intensity of famine by reason of the potato blight
of 1847&ndash;8 had to some degree become lessened; favourable summer
weather had brought about an abundant crop of grain, relief works were
in progress, the expenses of administration out of proportion to the
meagre sums which actually reached the workers. All the while political
and religious antipathies manifested themselves in violent forms;
murders perpetrated in the close vicinity of our county town.</p>

<p>Some of the alleged perpetrators of those crimes underwent their
trial at the County Assizes. Two were convicted and condemned to<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_77" id="Page_77">77</a></span>
death. On the day of their execution a guard provided by the 57th
was drawn up at a little distance from the main entrance of the prison,
where the apparatus for carrying out the extreme sentence of the law was
kept in readiness. Behind the soldiers the large open space then existing
was crowded with interested spectators, the proportion of women being
estimated as four to one of men. The dread ordeal over, one of our
men was brought to the regimental hospital in a condition of delirious
terror, his delusion that one of the men executed was dangling over his
head. All means used to soothe or relieve him failed; his horrible
delirium continued with little or no interruption through some few days
and nights, only ceasing with his own existence, for the same terrible
impression haunted him to the very last.</p>

<p>The system of “surprise inspections,” at the time in force, applied to
regiments and departments; inspecting officers were wont to appear
without warning, such ordeals being over and above those held in ordinary
course of routine. That the higher authorities saw good reasons
for their action in this respect is not to be doubted. Those reasons,
however, did not transpire; but among our soldiers the irritation caused
by unusual proceeding went far to overbalance whatever good might
have accrued from it.</p>

<p>On the 14th of March, 1850, the most sacred event of a man’s life
occurred in mine&mdash;&#8203;that event, my <span class="locked">marriage<a name="FNanchor_104" id="FNanchor_104" href="#Footnote_104" class="fnanchor">104</a></span> to Annie, daughter of
John Mackintosh, Esq., of Torrich. Time was pressing, for rumours
were in the air that the regiment was well up the roster for foreign
service. Leave of absence had accordingly to be curtailed; but, on
rejoining the 57th with my young bride, she was received with the same
kindness that had been shown to myself. Not many days thereafter,
she proceeded to Dublin, where, pending the arrival of the regiment,
including myself, she was most hospitably received by the family of a
brother <span class="locked">officer.<a name="FNanchor_105" id="FNanchor_105" href="#Footnote_105" class="fnanchor">105</a></span></p>

<p>Our progress to the Irish capital included several days’ march; for,
although railway communication could have been made use of for part
of the distance, the authorities had decided that it should not be so.
In our march, we passed through or were billeted for a night at
places in relation to which history records a good deal of what is
interesting. For example, Clones has an ecclesiastical history dating
back to the sixth century; Kells, otherwise <i>Kenlis</i>, boasts of ruins of a
monastery, said to have owed its foundation to St. Columba; in near
proximity to Trim stands the rectory of Larour, the former residence of
Dean Swift, and near it a fragment of what had been the house of<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_78" id="Page_78">78</a></span>
Stella. The ruins of Dangan Castle in the near neighbourhood were
interesting, in that in them was shown to us an apartment said to have
been the actual birthplace of the Duke of Wellington&mdash;&#8203;with what degree
of truth it was not deemed necessary to <span class="locked">inquire.<a name="FNanchor_106" id="FNanchor_106" href="#Footnote_106" class="fnanchor">106</a></span></p>

<p>The village of Maynooth, at the time of our march through it, was in
appearance wretched and decayed, even as compared to others along
our line of route. At its eastern end is the avenue that leads to
Carton, seat of Ireland’s only <span class="locked">duke.<a name="FNanchor_107" id="FNanchor_107" href="#Footnote_107" class="fnanchor">107</a></span> But the name of the village has
become associated with its Roman Catholic College, which dates from
1795, and was endowed by Sir Robert <span class="locked">Peel<a name="FNanchor_108" id="FNanchor_108" href="#Footnote_108" class="fnanchor">108</a></span> with an income yearly of
£30,000&mdash;&#8203;a measure much discussed at the time of our visit, as
indeed it has continued since to be.</p>

<p>Arrived in Dublin, the barracks assigned to the 57th were the Linen
Hall&mdash;&#8203;old, and long before then condemned as unfit for occupation;
accommodation for all ranks insufficient. Thus my experience in searching
for lodgings began. Some months elapsed; then the regiment was
“broken up,” small parties distributed among various barracks, to be,
after another interval, collected in the Royal Barracks&mdash;&#8203;large, spacious,
and, at the time, looked upon as well adapted for their purpose.</p>

<p>Duty, relaxation, pleasure, as represented in Ireland’s capital, succeeded
each other among our officers. In accordance with rules then
in force, much of my own time was taken up in connection with the
more military functions of parades, drills, field days, and ceremonial
“trooping the colours.” Regimental entertainments, levées, and
“receptions” at the Castle were so many interludes in our general
routine.</p>

<p>In accordance also with the custom of the time, civility and attention
in various ways by learned societies and institutions were extended to
medical officers of the garrison, myself included. Access to lectures in
the Colleges was placed at our disposal; so was admission to the
Botanical and Zoological Gardens. Invitations to picnics and to
boating excursions in the beautiful bay further helped to render pleasant
our stay in Dublin.</p>

<p>The once famous Donnybrook <span class="locked">Fair<a name="FNanchor_109" id="FNanchor_109" href="#Footnote_109" class="fnanchor">109</a></span> had not then become a thing of
the past, although its extinction was approaching. The assemblage of
people on the occasion comprised the wild in aspect, dirty in person,
squalid, imperfectly clothed, all more or less strongly smelling of
whisky, some dancing to music of their pipes; but so far as we saw,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_79" id="Page_79">79</a></span>
without the mirth, laughter, and other signs of Irish life of which we
had heard so much.</p>

<p>Through the advocacy of Sir De Lacy Evans, and almost by it alone,
officers of the Medical and Commissariat Departments were admitted to
the second and third grades of the Most Honourable Order of the
<span class="locked">Bath.<a name="FNanchor_110" id="FNanchor_110" href="#Footnote_110" class="fnanchor">110</a></span> In battles connected with recent campaigns, surgeons of British
regiments were exposed to fire of the enemy in a degree only second
to that of combatants, the casualties in killed and wounded among
them testifying to the risks ran by them in the performance of their
duties on those occasions. Other circumstances of military life tell
more against medical officers of regiments than those whose duties are
merely “combatant.” The combat over, the latter, if unscathed, takes
his rest, such as it may be under the circumstances, but the most
arduous duties of the former then begin. On marches incidental to
campaigns, the halting ground reached, requirements of the sick and
wounded must be attended to, often under great difficulties. In times
of epidemics, the combatant runs risks common to all; the surgeon, in
addition to them, is exposed to those incidental to close association
with subjects of those epidemics, together with mental and physical
wear and tear in the performance of professional duties. Hence arises
the proportionately high rates of mortality that prevail among junior
departmental ranks.</p>

<p>Some time thereafter, war was undertaken against the Kaffirs under
Sandilli, their chief. Eight infantry regiments were hastily dispatched
to take part in the coming campaign, and so the 57th was placed
among the first to proceed to the same destination in the event of reinforcements
becoming necessary. Married officers, therefore, lost no
time in forecasting arrangements to be made by them respectively in
the event of the anticipated contingency becoming a reality.</p>

<p>My personal arrangements in that respect became hastened by the
birth to me of a <span class="locked">son.<a name="FNanchor_111" id="FNanchor_111" href="#Footnote_111" class="fnanchor">111</a></span> Anticipating such an event, I had already
opened negotiations for exchange to a regiment serving in India, conscious
that colonial rates of pay and allowances were inadequate to
meet the needs of double establishments during war time. By-and-by
the time arrived when connection had to be severed with a regiment to
which I had become much attached, and of its traditions proud as
any other of its members. A farewell dinner, by invitation of Colonel
<span class="locked">Goldie<a name="FNanchor_112" id="FNanchor_112" href="#Footnote_112" class="fnanchor">112</a></span> and officers, and then adieu.</p>

<p class="drop-cap5"><span class="smcap1">Among</span> regiments stationed throughout the Punjab, then but recently
annexed, was the 10th Foot, to which, by <span class="locked">exchange,<a name="FNanchor_113" id="FNanchor_113" href="#Footnote_113" class="fnanchor">113</a></span> I was
now appointed. Towards that province I accordingly started without
delay. Arrived in London, we visited the great novelty of that day, the
palace of glass situated in Hyde Park, in which was held the International
Exhibition, progenitor of a long series as it was destined to be. No
time was lost in completing arrangements for the coming sea voyage
in so far as restricted pecuniary means permitted. Early in June we
embarked on board the <i>Lord George Bentinck</i>, I in charge of troops;
some hours thereafter the ship was under sail and away.</p>

<p>Among the incidents of our voyage these were recorded at the time of
their occurrence; namely, some of our crew drunk and insubordinate,
others impertinent; recruits undisciplined; junior officers unacquainted
with duties required of them. In a quarrel between soldier and sailor
the knife was used, fortunately without fatal result. The death-roll included
one child, a soldier who in <i xml:lang="la" lang="la">delirium tremens</i> jumped overboard,
another who accidentally fell into the sea during a squall at night,&mdash;&#8203;his
death-scream, as he fell, most painful to hear.</p>

<p>Far away in southern <span class="locked">latitudes<a name="FNanchor_114" id="FNanchor_114" href="#Footnote_114" class="fnanchor">114</a></span> we experienced a hurricane such as
occur from time to time in those regions. Ten days and nights it continued
to rage; hatchways battened down; men, women, and children
confined ’tween decks, deprived to a great degree of light and air, their
food and drink handed to and passed from each to other as best could be<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_81" id="Page_81">81</a></span>
under the circumstances; decks washed from stem to stern by heavy
seas, the ship running before the wind; sky so thick that “sights” were
impracticable, and so our exact position left conjectural for the time
being. This, added to experiences already mentioned, was the kind
of initiation into the rougher side of military life to which my wife was
subjected; she herself in delicate health, our infant son severely ill, his
“nurse” a young untrained woman, the wife of a recruit.</p>

<p>The sea voyage ended, our detachment was conveyed by steam-boat
and flats to Chinsurah, as on a former occasion when transit was by
means of country boats. Within a few days after arrival there, cholera
attacked our young recruits, many of whom, as also the wives of some
among them, fell victims. The sudden death of our child’s nurse was
the first shock and trying experience his mother had to face in India.</p>

<p>Starting on November 1, again by steamer and flats, our route was
by the Sunderbunds to reach the main stream of the Ganges. A week
previous that region was swept over by storm wave and hurricane, by
which several ships, among them the steamer <i>Powerful</i>, were wrecked.
Two days were occupied in passing along the narrow creeks that
intersect the partially submerged forest tract, a thousand miles in
superficial extent, to which the name of Sunderbunds is given. At the
end of that time we are in the Ganges.</p>

<p>Time passed without special incident. Arrived at Purbootpore, a
village on the left bank of the <span class="locked">river,<a name="FNanchor_115" id="FNanchor_115" href="#Footnote_115" class="fnanchor">115</a></span> the place was interesting only
as being the locality where, on August 11, 1851, the Moolraj of
Mooltan died, and was burned in accordance with Hindoo rites. He
it was who instigated, in April, 1848, the murder of Vans Agnew and
Anderson, and headed the revolt which led to the siege and capture of
that fortress by British forces, and proved to be the first act in the second
Sikh war of that year. The Moolraj was for upwards of two years detained
as a political prisoner at Calcutta; his health having given way,
Government sanctioned his transfer to Allahabad, and while on his way
thither death overtook him.</p>

<p>Not far from Buxar we passed the point of junction between the
river Kurumnassa and the Ganges. The former stream is by good
Hindoos held accursed, so that to touch its water is to them pollution.
This reputation, however, would seem to be of modern date,&mdash;&#8203;namely,
October 23, 1764, when the forces of Mir Cossim were defeated by
those under Major <span class="locked">Munro;<a name="FNanchor_116" id="FNanchor_116" href="#Footnote_116" class="fnanchor">116</a></span> pursued by them to that river, in which
many of them perished. It was a similar occurrence in 1826 on the
part of the Ashantees at Acromanté that gave to that place in Guinea<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_82" id="Page_82">82</a></span>
the name of “accursed,” by which it was known during my period of
service there.</p>

<p>In some respects our river voyage was pleasant; the cool dry air,
the incidents of each day including walks on shore, the peculiarities of
village life along the banks, the “fleets” and single craft we met,
became, in turn, sources of interest to us. As this the dry season advanced,
the size of the once mighty stream diminished, shoals became
numerous, boats ran aground, delay and other inconvenience the consequences.
On one such occasion several recruits from the particular
boat concerned, started away clandestinely in the shallow water to indulge
in the luxury of a river bath. Suddenly a scream was heard;
two of their number disappeared; whether engulphed in a quicksand,
or carried away by a crocodile, no one could tell.</p>

<p>Our river journey ended at Allahabad. Thence our progress was
to be by march along the Grand Trunk Road. A short halt was permitted
to enable officers to purchase such camp equipment and stores
as pecuniary means were equal to. Early in December we marched
out of the&mdash;&#8203;to me&mdash;&#8203;familiar place. Nine days thereafter, arrived at
Cawnpore, the terrible story in connection with which was in the not
distant future. Here my wife had her first experience of one of those
violent whirlwind storms whose distinctive name is taken from the
<span class="locked">locality;<a name="FNanchor_117" id="FNanchor_117" href="#Footnote_117" class="fnanchor">117</a></span> her surprise great on seeing some tents, articles of clothing,
etc., drawn up and disappearing in the meteor.</p>

<p>At Kullianpore I found my way into the enclosure of a Hindoo
temple. Great was my surprise at the offer of hospitality by the priests
connected with it, they being in the act of partaking of a meal as I
entered, the particular dish called “phillouree.” Of it accordingly I partook;
but the incident seemed to indicate that then at least my hosts
entertained no religious horror against the European.</p>

<p>Arrived at Meerut, the <i>Overland Express</i> brought news that “Louis
Napoleon having the army on his side has carried all before him, dissolved
the ministry and courts of law; has thrown himself on the
people, and intimated his readiness to be designated by any title they
may decide upon giving him.” The next act in the drama so announced
was soon to come.</p>

<p>Deobund was soon reached. There took place, in 1827, the last
suttee permitted under public sanction. Since that date the practice
has been officially suppressed, though it has been stated that isolated
instances have clandestinely occurred. On the former suttee ground
stood in its centre a temple; a series of small minarets of peculiar<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_83" id="Page_83">83</a></span>
device indicate spots on which immolation of widows had taken place.
The priests readily admitted us to the threshold of the shrine, but, unlike
their brethren already mentioned, offered no food. In the neighbouring
grove, numerous baboons&mdash;&#8203;representatives of Humayon, the
monkey god&mdash;&#8203;chattered and made grimaces at us.</p>

<p>At Saharunpore a visit was paid to the Botanic Gardens. The excellence
of their arrangement and management seemed to merit the
eulogies bestowed upon them, a centre as they are from which plants
are distributed throughout India, and to various European countries.
The process of acclimatization was particularly interesting; so also was
the care with which plants of temperate climates were being arranged
and packed for dispatch to hill sanatoria in the Himalayas, there to
remain throughout the coming hot season. It was a somewhat strange
thing to see a daisy being thus nursed.</p>

<p>At Jugadree the detachment, its stores and equipment, crossed the
Jumna, there so divided by shoals and islands as in effect to be four
different rivers. Across the first the men waded at an hour so early
that dawn had not appeared; the second and third were passed by
means of bridges of boats such as are common on Indian rivers; over
the fourth a bridge had been erected, so elegant in construction as
to claim general admiration. Through its arches rushed currents of
sparkling water, in the eddies and shallower parts of which were seen fish
rising to flies; along the banks grew willow, acacia, and wild fig trees,
the adjoining fields rich with well-irrigated crops of wheat. In the far
distance rose above the haze of morning the snowy peaks of Himalayah.</p>

<p>Arrived at Umballah, headquarters of the Sirhind Division, a short
halt was made, according to the custom of the time, for the double purpose
of repairing equipage and exchanging draught animals where
necessary. According also to the custom of the time, some of our
number were invited to partake of friendly hospitality by officers
stationed there.</p>

<p>Continuing, northward from Umballah were seen ruined remains of
pillars raised by order of <span class="locked">Jehangir<a name="FNanchor_118" id="FNanchor_118" href="#Footnote_118" class="fnanchor">118</a></span> to mark the halting places
of Noor Jehan, otherwise Noor Mahal, on her journey from Delhi
to Lahore. Those remains seemed to occur at intervals of six to
eight miles, representing the length of each daily journey of that
<i>Chère Reine</i>.</p>

<p>Loodianah had an interest in that, during a severe cyclone some years
previous, portions of barracks occupied by the 50th Regiment were
blown down, several men being killed in the catastrophe, besides many
injured. In the first Punjab war the Sikhs made a rush upon the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_84" id="Page_84">84</a></span>
station, set fire to and destroyed various bungalows and other buildings
within it. Further depredations by them were checked by their defeat
at <span class="locked">Aliwal<a name="FNanchor_119" id="FNanchor_119" href="#Footnote_119" class="fnanchor">119</a></span> by Sir Harry Smith.</p>

<p>Arrived at Kool, the position occupied by the army of Tej Singh
preparatory to the battle at Ferozeshah, we mounted elephants and so
rode to the field of that disastrous victory of December 21 and 22,
1845. Our ride for five miles was across open flat country, covered
here and there by acacia bushes, occasional patches of cultivation
occurring as we proceeded, the crops consisting of wheat and grain
(dolichos). The village of Ferozeshah, half concealed by groves, had
yet some remains of entrenchments and batteries, behind and on which
the Sikh guns were placed. Along the ground for a considerable distance
in front of that position lay scattered and bleached by six years’
exposure bones of gallant men, chiefly of the 62nd Regiment, for here
it was that so many of them were swept away on the first of those
eventful days. Of our small party there was one who had shared the
risks and “glory” of that battle, and now pointed out the several
positions occupied by the opposing forces.</p>

<p>Ferozepore, for many years the frontier station, ceased to be so
when, after the battle of <span class="locked">Sobraon,<a name="FNanchor_120" id="FNanchor_120" href="#Footnote_120" class="fnanchor">120</a></span> British occupation of the Punjab
took place. At one time a sandy plain, it had become beautified
by ornamental trees and shrubs, and in other respects somewhat
attractive in appearance.</p>

<p>Crossing in its near proximity the Sutlej&mdash;&#8203;Hesudrus of the time of
Alexander&mdash;&#8203;we were within the territory of the Punjab&mdash;&#8203;Panch-ab, or
“Five Rivers.” Five more marches and we encamped close to Lahore,
capital city of that province; our camp pitched on ground where in
former times had stood cantonments of troops in pay of Runjeet
Singh. In near vicinity stood houses of British officials, some tombs
and mosques, one of the latter transformed into an English church.</p>

<p>Arrived on the right bank of the Ravee (Hydraotis), our camp
occupied ground close to the tomb of Jehangir, and not far from that
of his empress Noor Jehan, “Light of the World,” whose romantic
history interested some of our number, if not all. Thence to
Goojeranwallah, birthplace of Runjeet, “Lion of the Punjab,” and
anciently the Buddhistic capital of the province. In recent times
the camp ground has obtained unpleasant notoriety, it being so infected
with poisonous snakes that a new site for that purpose has
been selected.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_85" id="Page_85">85</a></span>
Ten months’ travel by sea and land, I joined the regiment into
which, hoping thereby to advance my own prospects and position,
it had cost me so much in means and personal trouble to exchange.
Having done so, the occasion seemed opportune to take stock, as it
were, of that position. At the date in question regimental appointments
in India had their market value, according to their several
kinds, and the period still unrun of service in that country. That
of my own position was reckoned at £100 for each year so before
us; thus my exchange cost six and a half times that amount, in addition
to which the cost of passage, added to other unavoidable
expenses, placed me on the debit side to the extent of £1,180, all
of which, having had to be “raised” as best I could, was an incubus
to be got rid of with the least practicable delay. [Although anticipating
the order of this narrative, the fact may be stated in this
place that, by the aid of my dear wife and her patient submission
to curtailment of luxuries and even necessities, pecuniary obligations
were cleared off within eighteen months. As we shall see, troubles
of other kinds arrived against which it became most difficult to
bear up.]</p>

chosen as a site for what were to be cantonments was at the time
under indigo cultivation; on it tents were pitched and “lines”
drawn out in accordance with regulations bearing on the subject.
With the approach of hot weather the tents were walled and covered
in by mud, straw, and such other materials as under the circumstances
were obtainable; then the tents were struck, partitions of
mud “run up,” and so houses or bungalows formed. By similar
means “barracks” for the soldiers and their establishments were
erected; the whole declared to be the station of Wuzzeerabad.</p>

<p>Six miles away stood the city of that name; in its centre the palace
occupied by General Avitabile, in the service of Runjeet Singh, and
under him Governor of Peshawur at the time of the first war against
Affghanistan. Extending from the main entrance to the city, what
in former days must have been an imposing avenue of trees is represented
by dilapidated willow trunks; at intervals smaller towns and
villages occur, all surrounded by richly cultivated fields. Across the
river, said to attain a breadth of fourteen miles during the rainy
season, is seen the town of Goojerat; towards our left the position<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_87" id="Page_87">87</a></span>
of Chilianwallah; in the far distance the Pir-Punjal and other peaks
pertaining to the Cashmere range of the Himalayahs.</p>

<p>Our force, equipped as a “Flying Column,” was so held prepared
and ready, if need arose, for emergent service. Rumour had it that
among the people the state of things incidental to recent annexation
did not meet with universal acceptance; that the system of Thuggee
had extended to their country from Bengal, where for some
years previous it had been relentlessly hunted down by Colonels
Sleeman and Graham. At the new station of Sealkote an English
church was in course of being erected. In reference thereto the
strange report circulated among the natives that their children were
being kidnapped, to be there offered as sacrifices. Meanwhile two
expeditions were in progress of formation: the one to Swat, under command
of Sir Colin Campbell; the other to Burmah, under that of
General Godwin.</p>

<p>The hot season was soon upon us. As it advanced we became painfully
aware how unsuitable, under the circumstances, were the extemporised
“houses” already mentioned. By the aid of tatties and
<span class="locked">thermantadotes,<a name="FNanchor_123" id="FNanchor_123" href="#Footnote_123" class="fnanchor">123</a></span> it was possible to reduce temperature within doors
to something like 112° F.; but such contrivances were themselves
expensive, and in some instances beyond the means of individuals.
The sense of oppression from the prevailing heat was greater during
the night than in daytime; the stillness of the air, laden with impalpable
dust, affected not alone people, but quadrupeds and birds, while
over everything a yellow haze lay thick and heavy. Then would come
a thunder burst; forked lightning threatened, and in some instances
struck our houses; a downpour of rain would follow, and for a few days
thereafter all would be comparatively agreeable. Later on hurricanes
of dust burst upon us, their violence sufficient to unroof some houses
and barracks, to be followed by storms of rain, and ultimately by the
season so called. Early in September the hot season was at an end;
the moist atmosphere became even more oppressive than it had been
while dry heat prevailed, so that all of us looked forward anxiously to
the advent of cold weather properly so called.</p>

<p>All belonging to the regiment suffered considerably in health; deaths
of soldiers were numerous, the physical powers of all much depressed,
a large proportion thus unfit to take the field in case of emergency. It
was felt, however, that hospital <i>régime</i> was likely rather to increase
their disability than benefit their condition; hence they were permitted
to remain in barracks, though exempt from duty&mdash;&#8203;a circumstance here<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_88" id="Page_88">88</a></span>
noted as indicating the insufficiency of mere statistics to represent
conditions of physical fitness of troops.</p>

<p>Among the deaths was that of a young <span class="locked">surgeon,<a name="FNanchor_124" id="FNanchor_124" href="#Footnote_124" class="fnanchor">124</a></span> only a few months
in India when attacked by climatic illness, to which he succumbed.
For some time before life passed away, incapable of expression by
voice, his look of terror told plainly his state of mind as he faced
approaching death. The scene was most painful to witness.</p>

<p>On September 5, ’52, a daughter was born to me. The event took
place in early morning. Shortly after mid-day information reached my
beloved wife, through tittle-tattle of servants, that a <span class="locked">guest,<a name="FNanchor_125" id="FNanchor_125" href="#Footnote_125" class="fnanchor">125</a></span> who occupied
a tent in our compound, was dead by heat apoplexy. Several of our
men were struck down by the same disease, so that absence from my
own domestic sphere was unavoidable under the trying circumstances
of the day.</p>

<p>Within a week from her date of birth, an attempt was made by her
ayah to poison the infant, the reason for the intended crime neither
then nor subsequently ascertained. The prostrate mother from her
bed saw the native woman put “something” in the mouth of the babe,
who was immediately thereafter seized with tetanic spasms; nor was it
without much difficulty that her young life was saved.</p>

<p>The recent discovery of gold-fields in Australia led to a somewhat
unpleasant state of unrest on the part of a few soldiers serving in India.
Letters from friends and relatives in the colonies instigated them to
endeavour by means, whether foul or fair, to get sent thither, where
fortunes could very quickly be made. The result was the outbreak, as
if epidemic, of crimes of assault on officers and non-commissioned
officers, the idea being to get tried before a General Court-Martial and
sentenced to transportation; after which, once in Australia, it would be
an easy matter to find one’s way to the gold-fields. This “gold fever”
resulted in a Resolution by the Commander-in-Chief to put a stop to
the assaults in question; in one instance&mdash;&#8203;and it sufficed for the purpose
in view&mdash;&#8203;the death penalty awarded was carried <span class="locked">out.<a name="FNanchor_126" id="FNanchor_126" href="#Footnote_126" class="fnanchor">126</a></span></p>

<p>On a morning in June, while examining a soldier who was about to
appear before a Garrison Court-Martial on the charge of striking a
sergeant, I received from the prisoner a somewhat severe blow on the
forehead. Astonished at the occurrence, some little time was needed
to collect my thoughts and decide upon the line of official action most
suitable under the circumstances. In the interval I learned that the
Garrison Court-Martial had been intentionally ordered to assemble for<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_89" id="Page_89">89</a></span>
the express purpose of defeating the object the man was known to have
in view, and this being the case it was natural to assume that in
assaulting me he had in view trial and sentence by the more important
tribunal. Aware as I was that a sentence of death might be the
possible award, and desiring to avert such a penalty, in making the
official report of the assault I suggested that an inquiry should take
place as to his mental condition at the time. Three months elapsed,
and then the man appeared before that ordeal; he was found “not
guilty” on the plea of “insanity.” In due course he was sent to
Calcutta, to be taken there into the Lunatic Asylum. At the end of a
year he was discharged “cured” from that establishment, and while <i>en
route</i> to rejoin the 10th he died of cholera. So ended that episode.</p>

<p>About the time I was struck a similar assault was committed upon
the <span class="locked">surgeon<a name="FNanchor_127" id="FNanchor_127" href="#Footnote_127" class="fnanchor">127</a></span> of the 3rd Light Dragoons, occupying barracks also at
Wuzzeerabad. He took steps to have an inquiry made into the mental
condition of his assailant. On that inquiry I sat as president, and this
is the substance of the story told me by the man. From the time when
he first enlisted he had been haunted by visions of a murder committed
by himself and his “pal” on Wandsworth Common in 1845; he made
every endeavour to get killed while charging the Sikhs in battle; he had
committed offences so that he might be taken to the guard room, and
thence made pretended attempts to escape in the hope of being cut down
by the sentry; but failing in all these he had struck the officer, in order
that for so doing he might be tried, condemned, and shot. These
particulars were duly entered in the report submitted to the authorities;
meanwhile, the regiment to which he belonged received its orders for
home, and left the station, taking with it as prisoner this unhappy man.
It was not till long thereafter that the sequel of his story was heard of.</p>

<p>The death of the “Iron Duke” of Wellington, news of which was
received early in November, was made the text of remark and discussion,
the official acts and demeanour of His Grace towards officers
and the army generally being looked at from different and at times
directly opposite points of view,&mdash;&#8203;the impression which seemed most
generally to prevail being that although no one denied him the credit
of great services performed in the first fifteen years of the century, yet
for many years thereafter he had been “past his work”&mdash;&#8203;a commentary
which bears interpretation in more ways than one. It cannot be said
that many signs of mourning for his loss were apparent.</p>

<p>Early in 1853 English papers brought news among other matters
that Louis Napoleon had been recognised as Emperor by the Powers of<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_90" id="Page_90">90</a></span>
Europe, though not with good grace, that a suspicion existed of a
possible attempt at invasion was under consideration, an order for the
concentration of troops of the regular army and militia at particular
points being the outcome of that suspicion. Another item in those
papers reads strangely while these notes are being transcribed, and
conditions alluded to have developed in significance; namely, “The
influence of the lower orders is fast on the increase, and altogether we
seem to be on the eve of a crisis, the ultimate issue of which it is
impossible to predict.” Shortly thereafter came news of the Emperor’s
marriage to a Spanish <span class="locked">lady,<a name="FNanchor_128" id="FNanchor_128" href="#Footnote_128" class="fnanchor">128</a></span> his personal popularity in the army not
enhanced thereby. According to Indian journals, overtures had been
made to the British Resident at Moorshedabad, by Sirdars of
Affghanistan with a view to approach Government on the subject of
taking over that kingdom. The truth or otherwise of the report did
not transpire; but that the rumour was current was itself a suggestive
circumstance.</p>

<p>As the hot season advanced, snakes, poisonous and otherwise, became
numerous in cantonments. A sepoy while asleep was bitten by one of
those reptiles. He soon became unconscious; blood oozed from two
small punctures on the instep where he had been bitten, from his
mouth, nostrils, and from under his <span class="locked">finger-nails.<a name="FNanchor_129" id="FNanchor_129" href="#Footnote_129" class="fnanchor">129</a></span> He was treated by
means of large doses of ammonia and turpentine, and ultimately
recovered.</p>

<p>Prowling beasts of prey made night hideous. On one occasion much
alarm was occasioned by one of them becoming “rabid,” rushing
violently at and biting animals and people. Considerable numbers of
both were so injured by the pariah dog; some of those bitten were
treated, some not, but no specific results followed the injuries. In the
bazaars within cantonments prowling jackals and wolves were so many
dangers to infants asleep on charpoys at night; some instances
occurred in which they were carried away and devoured by the larger
animals mentioned.</p>

<p>The conditions of a soldier’s life in India at the time alluded to were
calculated rather to weary than enliven him. The climate ill suited
for out-of-door exercise; many of the men unable to read, and disinclined
to learn; their two resources the bazaar and the canteen;
their tastes and pursuits animal; mind a blank; the body a ready prey
to disease. Absolutely no good result was to be gained from official
reports on these points, and suggestions for improvements. I addressed<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_91" id="Page_91">91</a></span>
letters to the journals in the hope of enlisting attention in favour of
station reading rooms, lecture rooms, etc., but with the result that
little notice was taken of my representations.</p>

<p>In the 10th Regiment itself, through the action of two or three officers,
some of the soldiers enrolled their names as members of a “Mutual
Improvement Society.” Meetings were held; tea and other light
refreshments served in view to attracting men; lectures and demonstrations
given on such subjects as Forts and Battles mentioned in the
<span class="locked">Bible,<a name="FNanchor_130" id="FNanchor_130" href="#Footnote_130" class="fnanchor">130</a></span> Strata of the Earth’s Surface, Uses of the Human Body;
classes for reading and writing also set on foot. Not long thereafter,
a General <span class="locked">Officer,<a name="FNanchor_131" id="FNanchor_131" href="#Footnote_131" class="fnanchor">131</a></span> by order of the <span class="locked">Commander-in-Chief,<a name="FNanchor_132" id="FNanchor_132" href="#Footnote_132" class="fnanchor">132</a></span> arrived at
Wuzzeerabad “to put a stop to so dangerous an association.” Military
opinion was not then ripened for the innovation.</p>

<p>After some delay, and with considerable difficulty, a Book Club for
the soldiers was launched in the regiment; the officers were already
well provided in that respect. As with the one class, so with the other,
works on “service” subjects were mostly read, but intellectual occupation
was thus available whereby to pass the weary and exhausting days
of the hot season. [Recollecting these endeavours made by a small
number of us in 1853 to advance the intellectual condition of the
British soldier in India, the few of us who still live attach suggestive
significance to the extract now given from the most interesting work by
Lord Roberts, entitled <i>Forty-one Years in India</i>.<a name="FNanchor_133" id="FNanchor_133" href="#Footnote_133" class="fnanchor">133</a> Under the date 1887
he wrote: “My name appeared in the <i>Jubilee Gazette</i> as having been
given the Grand Cross of the Indian Empire, but what I valued still
more was the acceptance by the Government of India of my strong
recommendation for the establishment of a Club or Institute in every
British regiment and battery in India. Lord Dufferin’s Government
met my views in the most liberal spirit, and, with the sanction of
Lord Cross, ‘The Regimental Institute’ became a recognised
establishment.”]</p>

<p>The second hot season of our residence at Wuzzeerabad proved even
more severe than the first upon the health of our soldiers, large numbers
of whom suffered from illness special to the climate and locality.
Unfortunately for those so prostrated, the apathy and indifference of
the native servants connected with the hospital were such that many
lives were thus sacrificed which under more favourable circumstances<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_92" id="Page_92">92</a></span>
would in all probability have been saved. For example:&mdash;&#8203;A soldier in
barracks, during the hottest hours of the day, is discovered by his
comrades to be seized with heat apoplexy, or to be suffering from the
scarcely less alarming symptoms of ardent fever. He is by them placed
in a dooly and so dispatched to hospital. The bearers who carry him
are indifferent to life and suffering among themselves, but if possible
more so in respect to the white man, and so their pace is by no means
rapid. They reach the “surgery”; but there, if they find no one present,
they put their dooly down, while they themselves sit in the verandah to
smoke, perhaps to sleep. After an interval more or less long, the
presence of the sick&mdash;&#8203;it may be unconscious&mdash;&#8203;soldier is discovered; the
circumstance, after another interval, comes, or is brought to the knowledge
of the subordinate, who, just roused from his siesta, and considerably
narcotised by his “hookah,” takes time to collect his
energies, and so be able to visit him. Even then the actual nature
and severity of the attack is not always recognised and dealt with;
so when the surgeon pays his evening visit, the patient is dead.</p>

<p>Among those struck down by severe illness was my dear wife,
vitality brought to so low an ebb that only by holding a hand mirror to
her lips and observing the slight moisture left thereon could the fact be
realized that she still breathed. In this our time of trial, sympathy and
aid came unexpectedly, but not from sources whence they were looked
for as an outcome of services rendered. When her removal became
practicable, she proceeded by dooly dâk towards Murree, then newly
established as a hill station and sanatorium. Our cavalcade&mdash;&#8203;for I was
of the party&mdash;&#8203;crossed the Chenab, partly by boat, partly by being
carried through shallow water and marshy tracts. Arrived at Goojerat,
the field of battle, at a little distance from the city, was found to be
so overrun by vegetation as to be recognisable only by monuments to
individual officers erected on spots where they had fallen. The day
wore on; a messenger arrived, bringing, with “salaam from the
Collector <span class="locked">Sahib,”<a name="FNanchor_134" id="FNanchor_134" href="#Footnote_134" class="fnanchor">134</a></span> soup and other delicacies suitable for an invalid and
infants. He had heard casually that a lady, severely ill, was in the
dâk bungalow; hence this outcome of kind thoughtfulness towards
complete strangers to him, as we were.</p>

<p>Jhelum, on the river so <span class="locked">named,<a name="FNanchor_135" id="FNanchor_135" href="#Footnote_135" class="fnanchor">135</a></span> was the next stage of our anxious
journey. Thence, next night to Pucka Serai. Arrived at the dâk
bungalow, it was found that the building intended for travellers consisted
of one room; in it a single bedstead, on which lay an elderly field<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_93" id="Page_93">93</a></span>
officer, who, in transit to the hills, had arrived shortly before us. Attendants
were absent; supplies unobtainable; there was no alternative but
to carry my sick wife from her dooly and place her alongside the sick
officer. How the child and infant fared all day is not recorded.
Resuming our weary way as the cool breezes of evening set in, early
morning found us at Rawul Pindee, then as still a favoured military
station. Thence, in evening, towards the foot of the hilly range towards
which our journey was directed. Night had closed in before the actual
ascent began. As yet there existed no road properly so called. Progress
was slow: rocks and boulders in the way caused many difficulties;
but these surmounted, the light of our torches showed that in our
progress we had attained a region of precipices, rugged valleys, and
rapidly running streams.</p>

<p>As morning dawned we were set down at Trait, a place the loveliness
of which&mdash;&#8203;surrounded by pine-covered hills; its rich green vegetation,
the purling rivulets that traversed the valley, the coolness of the
breeze that wafted over us&mdash;&#8203;all these, delightful in themselves, exerted
upon my wife an effect to be described as magical. Then it was that
from her dooly the pale, emaciated form emerged. Enthusiastically
she clutched a twig of pine tree I had just cut; its grateful resin scent
brought to recollection associations of bygone days. From that moment
her recovery began.</p>

<p>The further journey to Murree was continued, the cool air at the
elevation of six to eight thousand feet, to which we had attained,
enabling us to travel by day, instead of only by night as in the plains.
A road was in course of being made, but as yet that by which we continued
was little else than a rugged mountain path, leading upwards
through forest composed of sycamore, pine, chestnut, and other trees
familiar in our English woods; the altered conditions of temperature,
scenery, and general surroundings were health-giving in their effect.
Before many hours had passed we were welcomed and hospitably received
by our friends, Dr. and Mrs. <span class="locked">Banon.<a name="FNanchor_136" id="FNanchor_136" href="#Footnote_136" class="fnanchor">136</a></span></p>

<p>A few days elapsed, and through the station bazaar rumour circulated
that on the 11th “a great earthquake would take place at Peshawur,”
“a native prophecy” having so declared. On the 13th information
was received that on the <span class="locked">11th<a name="FNanchor_137" id="FNanchor_137" href="#Footnote_137" class="fnanchor">137</a></span>&mdash;&#8203;namely, the date indicated&mdash;&#8203;Major
Mackeson, Chief Political Officer at Peshawur, had been assassinated
by an Affghan from Jallahabad; the murderer having delivered his
thrust raised his hand to repeat the blow, when&mdash;&#8203;so it was stated&mdash;&#8203;a<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_94" id="Page_94">94</a></span>
native rushed between them and received it. Subsequent information
led to the belief that the murder of political officers at various other
seats of local government had been intended, the existence of a conspiracy
with that object well known among the native population.</p>

<p>Rejoining the 10th without delay, like every other officer who observed
the signs of the times, I could not help seeing that as an immediate
outcome of the Peshawur murder, the aspect of public affairs, not only
on the North-Western frontier, but throughout India, rapidly became
such as to cause anxiety to administrators, while it led officers and
soldiers to speculate on the chances of active service. The prime
mover in the murder of Major Mackeson was believed to be Sadhut
Khan, chief of the Lalpoora State. Immediately on the occurrence of
the murder British troops were moved onwards from Rawul Pindee,
orders issued for others to march from other stations to take their place.
These proceedings occupied several days, as all such movements had to
be performed on foot. In the meantime the troops arriving at Peshawur
were received with signs of disaffection by the Mahomedans
of that city; while Rawul Pindee, left for the time being with a
diminished garrison, was threatened with attack by a band of Hazara
men under an impostor named Peshora <span class="locked">Singh,<a name="FNanchor_138" id="FNanchor_138" href="#Footnote_138" class="fnanchor">138</a></span> who pretended to be
a son of Runjeet Singh. That attack did not take place, but a movement
somewhat threatening in character was made towards Murree, at
the time occupied by invalid soldiers and their families, wives of officers
(mine included), and the small number of officials required for the
inconsiderable dimensions it had then attained.</p>

<p>On the night of September 28, some hours after darkness had
closed in, messengers sent round for that purpose spread the alarm
throughout that station that the Hazarees were rapidly advancing up
the hill towards it; orders at the same time issued by which all should
forthwith repair to the residence of the Commissioner, leaving their
houses “standing.” A heavy thunderstorm prevailed at the time;
lightning flashes at intervals lit up the miry pathways along which the
ladies and children had perforce to walk, in some instances a distance
of a couple of miles. My own dear wife, as yet unrecovered, and
unequal to such an exertion, was carried, together with her two children,
and so reached the general rendezvous, where earlier arrivals had barricaded
themselves as best they could by means of tables, chairs, and other
articles of furniture. Meanwhile the <span class="locked">Commissioner<a name="FNanchor_139" id="FNanchor_139" href="#Footnote_139" class="fnanchor">139</a></span> collected such
officers, soldiers, and police as could be brought together in the emergency.
Marching as best they could in the darkness, they came in<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_95" id="Page_95">95</a></span>
contact with the rebels at daylight, and after a smart skirmish dispersed
them, the Commissioner being wounded in the <i xml:lang="fr" lang="fr">rencontre</i>.</p>

<p>By the middle of October my wife, though far from restored to health,
was sufficiently well to return with her two children to the plains.
Starting from Murree in the evening, her palanquin-bearers speedily
showed themselves to be ill-disposed; while she, unprovided with a
guard, as some other ladies had been, was rendered helpless in what
proved to be a most painful position. Frequent halts, unnecessary
delays, repeated demands for buxees (presents), and general disregard
of her requests to keep the palanquins together, continued throughout
the long dreary hours of darkness, and well on in the following day.
It was afternoon before she was deposited at the dâk bungalow of
Rawul Pindee; but the party conveying her infant was nowhere in
sight, nor could tidings of it be obtained. Thus did several hours pass.
Then it was that the arrival of an <span class="locked">officer<a name="FNanchor_140" id="FNanchor_140" href="#Footnote_140" class="fnanchor">140</a></span> enabled my wife to communicate
to him her state of anxiety and alarm. Without delay he proceeded
to the residence of General Breton, in command, with the result that
a cavalry escort was dispatched in search of the missing ones. Another
period of delay, fear, and anxiety, and the palanquin with the infant
arrived. It appeared that her carriers had simply deposited her on the
roadside in the jungle, and dispersed. What might have happened
is painful to contemplate.</p>

<p>For some time past a charitable hospital for the benefit of the
native population in and around cantonments had been maintained by
subscriptions and other contributions from officers of our regiments, the
professional duties connected therewith being performed by myself.
Gratitude on the part of those who benefitted by that institution was
never expressed verbally, and in many instances not at all; indeed,
claims were in some made for pecuniary reward, on the plea that
individuals had submitted themselves to be operated upon. In a few
instances, however, active gratitude was expressed, even in a somewhat
demonstrative manner. The use of chloroform was then in its very
early stages. In the instance of a child, that anæsthetic was administered
while it lay placidly in its mother’s arms. When under the
influence of the drug, the little patient was gently lifted, placed upon
a table, operated <span class="locked">upon,<a name="FNanchor_141" id="FNanchor_141" href="#Footnote_141" class="fnanchor">141</a></span> then replaced in the position from which it had
been taken, still apparently asleep, and placid. The surprise of the
mother was very great; the whole thing declared by her to be <i>jadoo</i>&mdash;&#8203;that
is, witchcraft!</p>

entered the recently erected and spacious barracks of Meean Meer.
On the extensive plain where they stand, the Khalsa army assembled
in 1845, prior to the “invasion of India” by them, and prior to that date
quarters there existed for the troops of Runjeet Singh. On the same
plain in 1846, the victorious army under Lord Gough encamped, and

of the locality is that of a saint, a native of Bukkur in Scinde, who
flourished in the time of <span class="locked">Jehangir,<a name="FNanchor_143" id="FNanchor_143" href="#Footnote_143" class="fnanchor">143</a></span> and whose tomb still remains
in tolerable repair.</p>

<p>Among those who died in the early part of 1854 was the Brigadier
<span class="locked">commanding,<a name="FNanchor_144" id="FNanchor_144" href="#Footnote_144" class="fnanchor">144</a></span> an old officer whose service in India had extended over
about fifty years. He represented a class, then somewhat numerous,
of men who had proceeded to that country while as yet in their teens,
and thenceforward spent the whole or greater part of their lives in it.
The funeral was performed with full military honours; but what struck
us as incongruous and out of place was the suddenness with which,
after it had been completed, the strains of “The Dead March” were
succeeded by those of what were described as “rollicking” airs.
Surely, under such circumstances, it would be more appropriate were
the troops marched back in silence to their barracks.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_97" id="Page_97">97</a></span>
Unhappily a painful state of “tension” had for some time previous
existed in relations between the officer in command and those immediately
under him; confidence was seriously impaired among all grades;
actions and “system” of the superior looked upon as capricious,
influenced by personal feelings, and, in some instances, tyrannical.
The outcome of all this was, in respect to those affected, a condition
very difficult to be borne, an existence approaching the miserable in
place of one of friendly communication after the manner of regiments
in general. Among the ranks there was reason to believe that attempts
had been made, and others contemplated, against the objectional life.
The following incident was suggestive under the circumstances of the
time. A soldier came to hospital; a man of good character, long
service, and known never to shirk duty. To the usual question,
“What is the matter with you?” he answered, “Nothing, sir.” Then,
“What brings you here?” “Because I am harassed and worried to
death, and have come to ask if you can give me a day or two’s rest.”
His request was acceded to, and so, in all probability, a serious crime
averted.</p>

<p>In the middle of March a Lahore newspaper published what was the
first <span class="locked">telegraphic<a name="FNanchor_145" id="FNanchor_145" href="#Footnote_145" class="fnanchor">145</a></span> intelligence ever received in this part of India.
According to that intelligence, the Russian Ambassador to England
had taken his departure from London; France and England were dispatching
troops in view to joint action in support of Turkey, those from
our own country comprising twenty-two battalions, and so leaving only
eleven, exclusive of Household troops, in home garrisons. A month
later came the further news that all the forces in the United Kingdom
were under orders of readiness for service; that a powerful fleet had
been mobilised; the army materially augmented, several regiments
recalled from the West Indies, and the fleet dispatched to the Baltic.</p>

<p>On 30th of March a <span class="locked">son<a name="FNanchor_146" id="FNanchor_146" href="#Footnote_146" class="fnanchor">146</a></span> was born to me by my beloved wife, as I
wrote at the time&mdash;&#8203;another hostage to Fortune, and very material
inducement for exertion on my part to earn, if possible, means whereby
to maintain and educate my children in such a manner as is incumbent
upon me. The state of her health required that with the least practicable
delay she should proceed to the hills. A house was engaged
at Simla for the season, and there she passed the greater part of the
hot months.</p>

<p>My health having given way, I proceeded to that sanatorium somewhat
later in the hot season. Forty miles from the plains, and 7,600
feet above sea level, the climate of Simla is agreeably cool, but rain<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_98" id="Page_98">98</a></span>
so heavy that during the three months of summer the fall amounts to
100 inches. In the faces of declivities from rocks and mountain spurs
grew deodars and rhododendrons, intermingled with wild apple, cherry,
holly, walnut, etc.; orchids, ferns, ivy, and woodbine. Small but
rapid streams pursue their tortuous course over their rocky beds in
each narrow valley, and at a distance of some two or three miles are
two cascades of some 70 and 120 feet in height. Away in the distance
the magnificence of the snowy range, consisting of what seems like an
interminable succession of white glistening peaks, fixes the mind in
wonder and admiration; while in a clear day it is possible to see the
plains, together with the windings of the river Sutlej.</p>

<p>The “inauguration”&mdash;&#8203;otherwise commencement&mdash;&#8203;of what was to be
the great canal uniting the Ganges and the Jumna was duly celebrated.
The subject of that canal was discussed in the public papers from
different points of view; the channel, while intended to irrigate many
tracts that stand in need of being so fertilised, would be used in places
where such aid to agriculture was not required, and in certain localities
“malaria” would appear where none now exists. It may be curious to
compare those predictions with the results of experience.</p>

<p>Somewhat later in the year a Cheap Postage Act came into operation
in India, according to the system adopted in England since 1841.
Another matter noted at the time had reference solely to the army;
namely, that an entire change took place in the uniform of soldiers and
officers, one item relating to which was that thenceforward the infantry
were directed to leave the upper lip unshaven,&mdash;&#8203;in other words, to grow
<span class="locked">moustachios.<a name="FNanchor_147" id="FNanchor_147" href="#Footnote_147" class="fnanchor">147</a></span></p>

<p>In the middle of October my wife and children arrived from the
hills. With health restored she was able to enjoy rides and other
excursions around our station, the crisp morning air of the Punjab
restoring to her cheeks, as to those of others that had become pallid,
the rosy tinge natural to them. The frequency with which field-days
and other great military displays took place&mdash;&#8203;for our force numbered
13,000 fighting men&mdash;&#8203;gave her, with other ladies, opportunities of
being present on such occasions, and entertainments of sorts furnished
us with an object or excuse to visit what were then the well-kept
and ornamental gardens of Shalimar, the original planning of which
is credited to Sultan Beg, an “Admiral of the Fleet” to Shah Jehan.</p>

<p>Occasional visits had to be made to Lahore, the history of which
city presenting many points of interest, a few particulars relating
thereto may be interpolated in this place. Surrounded by a line of<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_99" id="Page_99">99</a></span>
ramparts now dismantled and rapidly going to decay, sufficient remains
to indicate the great strength of the original fortifications. At regular
intervals there are gateways, at each of which a strong guard was
formerly posted for defence. Through one such gate we entered, and
were immediately in a labyrinth of narrow and crowded streets. The
houses, built partly of brick, partly of sandstone, are three and four
stories in height, their fronts more or less elaborately ornamented by
carvings of different kinds, but all such devices presenting evidence of
decay. What formerly was the palace of Dyhan Singh is now a pay
office for British troops. The Shish Mahal, or Glass Palace, is much
defaced; the precious stones of its mosaic work taken away, the spaces
at one time occupied by them giving to the whole an aspect of
dilapidation even beyond what has actually taken place. What was
the audience hall, however, remains in good repair, the walls and
roof ornamented by mirrors of various sizes, some set in silver frames,
others in those of gold, the whole interspersed with paintings done in
the most gorgeous colours. But how changed the style of occupants
now from that which in days gone by harmonized with such surroundings!
As we entered, there sat upon the marble floor a motley crowd
of Sikhs, men and women, old and young, their costumes betokening
that they were of the labouring classes; the mission that brought
them hither to receive, at the hands of representatives of the great
Company Bahadur, pensions for sons, husbands, or fathers who fell
in battle against that wonderful and mysterious abstraction known to
“the masses” of India only by that designation. In close vicinity
to the Shish Mahal was a large mosque, very similar in style and appearance
to the Jumna Musjid at Delhi; it was now occupied as a
magazine. Thence we proceeded to the gateway where a few years
ago Rajah Nao Nehal Singh lost his life,&mdash;&#8203;whether by accident or
design is still by some few persons considered doubtful. Adjoining
that gate stands the tomb of Runjeet Singh, on entering which we
found two priests ready to give whatever aid the Feringhee might
stand in need of. Under a coverlet of green cloth the Grunth, or
Holy Book of the Sikhs, was carefully preserved; but the cloth was
raised for us, so that we might look upon the sacred volume. In a
shrine under an unfinished dome within the temple or tomb, the ashes
of Runjeet were preserved, the shrine itself concealed under a green
cloth; the walls of the mausoleum covered with paintings and other
representations of Sikh mythology. In another building, though of
less artistic appearance than that mentioned, were preserved the ashes
of Nao Nehal Singh and of Soochet Singh; between the two shrines
containing them lay covered as before the Grunth.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_100" id="Page_100">100</a></span>
In the last week of October came news that the Russian camp before
Sebastopol had been forced, but with a loss to the allied forces of
2,500 in killed and wounded. Many of us, besides the interest natural
to the important events then taking place in the Crimea, had personal
acquaintances among the actors in the drama of war there in progress,
and were moreover conscious of an existing possibility that we also
might be transferred to that sphere of action&mdash;&#8203;a possibility looked
at from various points of view, according to circumstances, pecuniary
and matrimonial, of individual officers.</p>

<p>The Indian papers of the day gave currency to a report that our
quondam ally and prisoner Dost Mahomed had been making
endeavours, by means of vakeels, to sound the Indian Government
in regard to an alliance, offensive and defensive; intimating at the
same time the possibility of his coming to terms with Russia, should
his proposal be rejected. But according to the views expressed at the
time, little danger was apprehended in the North-West,&mdash;&#8203;that is, from
Russia,&mdash;&#8203;on account of the natural mountain barrier that serves as a
defence in that direction.</p>

<p>Early in 1855 news reached us that Inkerman had been <span class="locked">won<a name="FNanchor_148" id="FNanchor_148" href="#Footnote_148" class="fnanchor">148</a></span> by
our troops, though at a cost to those engaged of 2,600 in killed and
wounded out of 6,000, the 57th being among the heaviest sufferers.
Several <span class="locked">regiments<a name="FNanchor_149" id="FNanchor_149" href="#Footnote_149" class="fnanchor">149</a></span> had already been sent direct from India to the
Crimea; the 10th expecting to follow to the same destination, officers
and soldiers composing it held themselves prepared for such an
emergency, which however did not occur. Among ourselves the
chances of service nearer at hand were freely discussed, as were
possible risks that might attend the further withdrawal of troops
from India. That a state of unrest existed was declared from day
to day in the columns of the local papers, and was evident to all who
chose to pay attention to palpable indications. Few, if any, of us
at the time gave a thought to the conditions to which that unrest
was due, nor to the outbreak in which it was so soon to culminate.</p>

<p>All ranks and grades pertaining to regiments were interested in the
varying phases of public affairs, their personal comfort, convenience,
and possible prospects being likely to be affected thereby. For some
time past Persia had treated British representatives with growing
marks of disrespect, and now the circumstance led to the withdrawal
from Teheran of the Commissioner of Her Majesty at that capital.
There were, moreover, suspicions of an intended movement on Herat,
in accordance, as believed, with Russian instigation; consequently,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_101" id="Page_101">101</a></span>
the early dispatch of an expedition was looked upon as a probable
contingency,&mdash;&#8203;the object, according to one set of views, to “assist”
the Shah; according to another, to coerce him. Speculation was
indulged in as to the regiments most likely to be so employed,
“ours” being considered one of the most likely to be so. Our
arrangements were made accordingly; but a year had to elapse before
war was actually declared.</p>

<p>In the month of July (1855) came the unexpected news that the
Santhals had broken out in rebellion. We asked each other, Who
are the Santhals? They were a half-savage tribe inhabiting the
Rajmahal Hills; nor was it possible at the time to ascertain the
ostensible cause of their outbreak. The troops sent against them
consisted of a local <span class="locked">corps,<a name="FNanchor_150" id="FNanchor_150" href="#Footnote_150" class="fnanchor">150</a></span> composed of their own tribesmen, the
natural result being that they fraternised with the rebels. The next
“force” dispatched to quell the outbreak was a body of sepoys of the
7th <span class="locked">N.I.,<a name="FNanchor_151" id="FNanchor_151" href="#Footnote_151" class="fnanchor">151</a></span> and they, it was reported, fired over the heads of the rebels,
their officers using their fists upon the men who did <span class="locked">so.<a name="FNanchor_152" id="FNanchor_152" href="#Footnote_152" class="fnanchor">152</a></span> Meanwhile
the rebellion spread; depredations and murders were committed
wholesale. Martial law was proclaimed in the disturbed districts;
troops were employed during seven months against men armed to a
great extent with bows and arrows; at last the guerilla warfare was
brought to a close. The inaction of the sepoys on the occasion
alluded to became significant some time thereafter when the great
mutiny occurred.</p>

<p>The death of the Czar and accession to the Russian throne of
Alexander were the most important items of intelligence brought by
the mail arriving early in April; another, his expressed determination
to continue the war with vigour. Other items of intelligence noted
at the time as having more or less important bearings upon affairs in
India, included the withdrawal of Lord Aberdeen from the Ministry
and the appointment of Lord Palmerston as his successor; the death
of Joseph Hume, who, it was remembered, had begun his career in the
Burmese war of 1824&ndash;26; and lastly, the cross-fire between Admiral
Sir Charles Napier, on his return from Cronstadt, and Sir James
Graham, the First Lord of the Admiralty. Then came details of
the attacks on the Mamelon and Malakoff Towers, and of the
losses incurred by our troops, more especially by the 57th. Following
thereon, intelligence arrived of the outbreak of cholera among
the allies in the Crimea, and of the death thereby of Lord Raglan.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_102" id="Page_102">102</a></span>
In the early days of September, the serious illness of my wife at
Simla rendered it necessary that I should proceed thither without
delay. On the journey all went well, till on arriving at the river
Beas&mdash;&#8203;the Hyphasis of the ancients&mdash;&#8203;the palkee in which I was
being conveyed across, by means of a boat, was by some mischance
permitted to fall into the stream, after which accident, time so pressed
that without interruption I continued my journey. Arrived at the
foot of the hills, I mounted a horse, and, lantern in hand,&mdash;&#8203;for night
had now closed in,&mdash;&#8203;I proceeded along the rough footpath which
then was the only representative of a road. Soon the darkness was
absolute; the roughness of the pathway had increased; the thick
jungle was close to me on either side. Then it was that my steed
stumbled and fell; myself and lantern were on the ground; my
light extinguished. In this condition of things I perforce remained
a considerable time, until a party of pedestrians, having at their
head a torch-bearer, came upon me. I was glad to return with
them to the nearest staging bungalow, and there remain till morning.
Next day I resumed my journey. I reached my destination tired and
feeling much indisposed.</p>

<p>Five days thereafter I was seized with what proved to be a most
serious illness. One day of intense headache, another of shivering,
then prostration, then delirium, after which a blank of more than a
couple of weeks. Such were the results of this untoward journey.
During those days and nights of delirium, a succession of very horrible
dreams, hallucinations or mental wanderings haunted me, one of the
most painful being that everything in my room&mdash;&#8203;bed, tables, chairs, etc.&mdash;&#8203;was
alive, and that I myself was double; at the same time I was
haunted with an intensely strong desire to die. In the third week of
my illness my state was so far improved that I was able to sit up
in bed, but only for a few minutes in the day. During this trying
and anxious time to my dear wife, she had to tend me, not only by
day, but also at night; her servant, the wife of a soldier, assisting
her. It was in these circumstances that she gave birth to a son on
October 7.</p>

<p>Weak in body, and ill as I was, my wife far from recovered,
with the additional charge of a baby to that of a sick husband, we
left Simla on October 26; in due time arrived at Umballah, and
on November 4 joined my regiment there, it being <i>en route</i> to
Dinapore. The following day I underwent the ordeal of having the
uvula cut off, that organ having become so elongated during the
severity of my illness as by constantly irritating the throat to add to the
severe cough and lung complication which formed part of my illness.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_103" id="Page_103">103</a></span>
Much of our march was by road already traversed. Our usual hour of
starting ranged from three to four in the morning; we had to rise at
least an hour before that time, and I well remember how on such
occasions my dear wife, herself very ill-fitted by reason of the weak state
of her health, prepared for me a cup of egg-flip, and so enabled me to
bear removal from my camp bed to the dooly in which I travelled.
But as we marched from day to day, health so far recovered that I
became able to walk some little distance at a time by means of a stick.
My left lower limb was much the weaker of the two, but at first I
failed to perceive that it was to some degree paralysed.</p>

<p>On Christmas Day our young infant was observed to be somewhat
ill. With great rapidity his symptoms increased in severity, and on the
last day of the year death came as a relief to his sufferings. As soon as
practicable after the severity of his illness declared itself, we hurried
on from camp to the dâk bungalow at Barode, and there the dear
innocent babe passed away to his rest. The thought of leaving the
remains of our loved one in the jungle was horrible; we accordingly
procured such a coffin as could be roughly put together by the bazaar
carpenter, and with our melancholy burthen pushed on to Benares, where
we arrived at 1 a.m. on New Year’s Day. It was not, however, until
sunset of the same day that arrangements for the interment were
completed, and the remains reverently committed to earth in the
Military Cemetery.</p>

<p>Four months elapsed, illness still prostrated me. Recovery was little
likely to occur while I remained in India; consequently there was no
alternative but to proceed on sick leave to England. On arriving at
Calcutta, much difficulty was experienced on obtaining temporary
accommodation, the hotels and other establishments being full. After
some delay quarters in Fort William were assigned to me; furniture
and equipment obtained on hire, and so I waited until official routine
had been gone through, and authority granted for my departure.</p>

<p>For some time past the contemplated annexation of Oude was known
throughout the military stations of India. The carrying out of that
intention was naturally looked forward to as likely to result in a force
being assembled, and perhaps engaged on active service. My own
incapacity to take part in any such service was a severe disappointment.
When, added to my physical condition, the fact that pecuniary affairs
had not yet emerged from a state of difficulty, and that prospects were
far from bright as to health being ever restored sufficiently to enable me
to meet responsibilities attached to me as “bread-winner,” the general
survey of the position in which I stood was decidedly depressing. In
one respect it was a relief to me to learn that all chances of service had<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_104" id="Page_104">104</a></span>
been averted; that Oude had been annexed without the necessity for
sacrificing life&mdash;&#8203;at that time at least.</p>

<p>In the suite of rooms adjoining ours in Fort William an officer was
suddenly seized with cholera, the attack rapidly progressing to his
death. After that event his young wife, who had been constant in her
attentions to him, observed his fingers move spasmodically, as often
happens in such cases; thereupon she rushed to the medical officer in
attendance, exclaiming frantically, “He lives, he lives; why say you
that he is dead?” Nor was it easy to convince her that her hopes were
vain,&mdash;&#8203;that he had gone to his rest. The scene was altogether a very
painful one to witness, though one by no means uncommon in India.</p>

<p>Suffering as I was from physical weakness, and conscious of the
possibilities that might happen to those dependent upon me, in the
probable contingency which now presented itself vividly to my mind,
the fact that for some days I became prostrated under the influences
then prevailing was no surprise to myself. On the 5th of March the
<i>Marlborough</i>, in which we had embarked the previous afternoon,
started in tow of a steamer; but what between breakdowns and other
mishaps, it was not until the 17th&mdash;&#8203;St. Patrick’s Day&mdash;&#8203;that our homeward
voyage really began.</p>

<p>The voyage was by no means propitious, for, as noted at the time
various causes of discomfort and inconvenience were at work. Scarcely
had we got to sea before the woman engaged to attend our children
became ill, and so gave up her work; mumps and whooping-cough
affected nearly every child on board; my eldest had a tedious
attack of fever; my wife became ill, partly from arduous attendance on
the children, partly from the unwholesome conditions on board.
Gradually there had become perceptible a stench, which in its intensity
affected seriously the health of the people on board, and rendered discoloured
the white-lead paint throughout the vessel, the plated dishes,
and articles in personal wear. Pumps were set to work and kept continually
in use; myriads of maggots were thus taken up with the bilge-water,
proving the existence in the depths of the vessel of animal
matter in a state of decomposition. A formal representation by the
<span class="locked">officer<a name="FNanchor_153" id="FNanchor_153" href="#Footnote_153" class="fnanchor">153</a></span> commanding the invalids on board and myself to the captain
was made on the subject, with a request that he would put in at Delagoa
Bay. That representation was ignored; and so the remaining portion of
the voyage had to be got over, the conditions just mentioned having,
as expressed, “to wear themselves out.”</p>

<p>On the 1st of July we passed the Azores at so short a distance from<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_105" id="Page_105">105</a></span>
them that we were able to enjoy the view of those beautiful islands.
Nearing Plymouth, our ship was boarded by a venerable pilot, who,
though seventy years of age, was actively employed in his responsible
and arduous vocation. On the 14th of that month we reached Gravesend,
and there disembarked; my wife infirm in health, two of our
children unrecovered from their attacks of illness while on board,
myself with one limb disabled, my physical condition to a great extent
wrecked. In due course the ordeal of a Medical Board was gone
through; the members of that body were able to appraise the
significance of that condition, but in accordance with “the system”
of the day were unable to recommend leave of absence for any
longer period than three months&mdash;&#8203;a period obviously insufficient for
restoration to health and activity.</p>

<p>A few weeks were spent in travelling in search of health. The fact
being evident that further leave must be applied for in due time,
the climate of Aberdeen was selected as one suited to my then
condition; in that city, accordingly, we remained for several successive
months, with result as anticipated, that the bracing winter air proved
to be health-restoring and invigorating, though the period during
which I was permitted to enjoy it was insufficient for its full
benefit being obtained. In various ways civility was shown to us by
residents. On the winter “session” at Marischal College being opened,
a kind invitation was sent to me by Dr. Pirie to attend his lectures.
Little thought I at the time how soon some of the valuable teaching
communicated in those lectures was to be practically applied.</p>

<blockquote>

<p>An unpropitious New Year&mdash;&#8203;Depart for India&mdash;&#8203;A quotation&mdash;&#8203;Distilling water&mdash;&#8203;First
news of Sepoy mutiny&mdash;&#8203;Madras&mdash;&#8203;Conditions at Calcutta&mdash;&#8203;The

and Agra cut off&mdash;&#8203;Rejoin the 10th.</p></blockquote>

<p class="drop-cap3"><span class="smcap1">The</span> year 1857 began with me inauspiciously. Unrecovered from
illness, it was necessary that I should proceed to the metropolis,
there to appear before a Medical Board. A short extension of leave
being granted by that tribunal, the fact was communicated in a
manner personally offensive, with the intimation superadded that if at
the expiration of the period I was still unfit to join my regiment, I
must make way for a more efficient officer.</p>

<p>The aspect of affairs, so far as I was concerned, was gloomy. On
the one hand I had the prospect of half-pay for an indefinite time, on a
<span class="locked">rate<a name="FNanchor_154" id="FNanchor_154" href="#Footnote_154" class="fnanchor">154</a></span> quite insufficient to meet the ordinary needs of myself and family;
on the other, to return to India in the state of physical illness in
which I then was. Taking an estimate of my worldly means, the circumstance
came out that from insurance, and small amount of investments
as they then stood, comparing the result with income on half-pay, the
receipts of my wife as a widow would exceed by a trifling amount
that to which I should be entitled in the alternative first named.
Thereupon decision was quickly made; a solicitor prepared my “last
will and testament.” I placed the document in the writing portfolio
of my wife; took leave of her as she lay weak and ill in <span class="locked">bed;<a name="FNanchor_155" id="FNanchor_155" href="#Footnote_155" class="fnanchor">155</a></span> started
away to rejoin my regiment, the children clapping their little hands as
I did so, and shouting, “Papa’s gone away for toys.”</p>

<p>Embarking<a name="FNanchor_156" id="FNanchor_156" href="#Footnote_156" class="fnanchor">156</a> at Gravesend, the earlier part of our voyage was without
special incident. The excellent selection of books sent on board for
the use of the troops&mdash;&#8203;for a considerable number were being conveyed
to India&mdash;&#8203;enabled those who so desired to get through a good deal of<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_107" id="Page_107">107</a></span>
reading. A passage in one of those works seemed so appropriate at
the time to personal conditions that it was duly noted; namely, “The
evil we suffer is often a counter-check which restrains us from greater
evil, or a spur to stimulate us to good. We should therefore consider
everything, not according to present sensation of pain, or the present
loss or injury it occasions, but according to its more general, remote,
and permanent effects and bearings&mdash;&#8203;whether our higher faculties are
not brought more into play, and our mental powers more invigorated by
the meditation and experiments necessary to secure <span class="locked">ourselves.”<a name="FNanchor_157" id="FNanchor_157" href="#Footnote_157" class="fnanchor">157</a></span></p>

<p>A considerable part of the voyage passed without special incident.
Some “heavy” weather was experienced, but in that respect nothing
unusual or of a kind likely to do harm to ship or stores. Great, therefore,
was the consternation with which we learnt that water casks and tanks
had so suffered that the sea water had got into and rendered their
contents unusable. At the time we were in the latitude of the
Mauritius, and about twelve hundred miles east of that island. What
was to be done? The chief officer and myself devised a distilling
apparatus, constructed with kettles, boilers, gun-barrels, and leaden
pipes of <i>sorts</i>. Our success was considerable; some twenty gallons of
“fresh” water were thus obtained throughout the day, and so on during
twenty-two that had to pass before land was reached, though from some
of our lady passengers comments were not wanting as to the “nasty”
taste of the product. Meanwhile fuel ran short; bulkheads and spars
had to be utilised; our ship reduced to skeleton state. In that condition
we arrived off Madras and anchored.</p>

<p>The news we there received was at the moment astounding, as it was
unexpected. The greater part of the Bengal army in open mutiny;
sepoys murdering their officers, together with their wives and children;
widespread disaffection among the native troops of both the other
Presidencies. As written at the time, and when the intelligence was
fresh: “It appears that the ostensible cause of the outbreak was the
issue of cartridges greased with animal fat. But for a long time past
a deep-rooted determination has existed among the natives to throw off
a foreign yoke, and to raise for themselves a king of the Delhi line
of succession. Large numbers of mutineers are said to have fled
to the imperial city; many officers and their families have been
massacred.”</p>

<p>At Madras the state of things indicated that something very serious
and unusual was in progress. European residents enrolled as volunteers;
Fort St. George in process of being manned and provisioned;<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_108" id="Page_108">108</a></span>
ammunition got ready for immediate use; at each post where stood a
native sentry there was also placed a British soldier, or pensioner, the
latter “embodied” and armed for the occasion. The <span class="locked">regiment<a name="FNanchor_158" id="FNanchor_158" href="#Footnote_158" class="fnanchor">158</a></span> in
the fort was held ready for emergencies; so were the artillery at
St. Thomas’ Mount. The Mahomedan inhabitants of Triplicane, a
suburb of Madras, were declared to be in open revolt.</p>

<p>At the mouth of the Hooghly the arrival of the pilot on board
was eagerly looked for, his recital of news listened to with painful
interest. In that recital particulars were given of murder and <span class="locked">atrocities<a name="FNanchor_159" id="FNanchor_159" href="#Footnote_159" class="fnanchor">159</a></span>
committed by mutineers on women and children, the names of the
victims at the same time given. Disembarking at Calcutta early in
August, unusual military turmoil was in progress. At short intervals
throughout the city parties of extemporised volunteers were posted;
Fort William was in course of reinforcement; the streets were patrolled
by armed parties of Europeans, while everywhere an air of unrest
seemed to prevail. At Government House sentries of the Body
Guard were on duty, their arms the ramrods of their carbines. An
impression existed that as the date was that of the Mahomedan
festival, the <span class="locked">Buckra-eed,<a name="FNanchor_160" id="FNanchor_160" href="#Footnote_160" class="fnanchor">160</a></span> the occasion was likely to be celebrated by
an attack on the capital&mdash;&#8203;a belief which derived support from the fact
that a spy from the King of Oude, then at Garden Reach, had been
captured while conveying a traitorous letter, his trial and execution
following thereupon without much delay. Other preparations in progress
indicated the conditions of the time; accommodation, stores of
food and clothing, as well as other requirements, were being got ready
in anticipation of women and children, survivors from deeds of blood
at up-country stations, who were known to be on their way hither.
Comments were very freely made on the energy displayed by commanders
in some instances, in contrast with pusillanimity in others.</p>

<p>A passage order obtained, I embarked as deck passenger&mdash;&#8203;for there
was no spare cabin&mdash;&#8203;on board the river flat <i>Soorma</i>, proceeding with
a body of Sikh troops and their officers, Sir James Outram and staff
being in the steamer to which the <i>Soorma</i> was connected. On the day
of our departure we met in the Hooghly a steamer and its flat, both
crowded with ladies and children who had succeeded in effecting their
escape, but whose husbands, fathers, or other relations had for the
most part fallen victims at their respective stations.</p>

<p>Very terrible were the tales some of the “refugees,” as they were called,
told of atrocities committed within their own knowledge, or of which<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_109" id="Page_109">109</a></span>
they had received what in their estimate was authentic information.
A few examples must suffice:&mdash;&#8203;Two young <span class="locked">ladies<a name="FNanchor_161" id="FNanchor_161" href="#Footnote_161" class="fnanchor">161</a></span> stripped naked, tied
to hackeries, and so driven through the streets, then dishonoured by
sweepers and barbarously murdered. A lady tied up in her own house,
and so forced to witness the murder of her husband. An officer, to
save his wife and child from dishonour and abuse, shot them both,
before being himself cut down. The massacre at Cawnpore perpetrated
by bazaar butchers employed for the purpose. A young lady with her
own hand killing five of her assailants, then throwing herself upon her
sword rather than fall into the hands of their fellows. A lady, with her
husband and child, while endeavouring to escape on horseback; her
husband dying in the jungle as a result of exposure; she forced to
abandon his corpse, and with her child continue their flight. And
so on.</p>

<p>At Berhampore, the 11th Irregular Cavalry and 63rd N.I. had
recently been disarmed; their horses and arms collected around the
military hospital; that building put into a state of defence; houses in
its vicinity in process of destruction; guns and other arms being sent
into the station by the Nawab of Moorshedabad.</p>

<p>At Rajmahal news received that mutineers besieging Arrah had been
dispersed; that “something” had happened to a party of the 10th.
Havelock’s force, in its advance on Lucknow, severely seized by cholera;
losses by <span class="locked">death,<a name="FNanchor_162" id="FNanchor_162" href="#Footnote_162" class="fnanchor">162</a></span> and inefficiency by sickness so great that he was under
the necessity of returning to Cawnpore, there to dispose of sick, and
obtain reinforcements preparatory to resuming his advance. Sorties by
the rebels in Delhi repulsed with heavy loss to them; Lord Elgin
arrived at Calcutta, accompanied by some marines and artillery; other
reinforcements expected to arrive in a few days.</p>

<p>At Bhaugulpore the display of the Union Jack from a Mahomedan
mosque indicated the fact that the edifice was occupied by British
<span class="locked">troops.<a name="FNanchor_163" id="FNanchor_163" href="#Footnote_163" class="fnanchor">163</a></span> We learned also that a portion of the 5th Irregular Cavalry,
suspected of mutinous intentions, were about to be disbanded by the
90th Regiment in progress up country; that a few days previous men
of the former corps, occupying a station in near vicinity of this place,
murdered Sir Norman Leslie, one of their officers, and wounded
several others; that, notwithstanding these circumstances, the officer in
command urged his confidence in the loyalty of his men, as a reason
that they should be spared from the disgrace of being disarmed. His<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_110" id="Page_110">110</a></span>
prayer was acceded to. That night the men deserted their officers,
rode off with their horses to join the 32nd N.I., at Deoghur.</p>

<p>Monghyr was in a state of panic; a small body of the Northumberland
Fusiliers, aided by residents, doing their best to put the dilapidated
fort in a state of defence, and making other preparations against
possible emergency.</p>

<p>Communication with Agra and Delhi only practicable <i>viâ</i> Bombay;
all direct telegraph wires destroyed; military and residents at the first-named
place, secure within the fort, declaring themselves able “to hold
out” for a long time, notwithstanding that in a <i>sortie</i> against the rebels
they had suffered severely; at Delhi offensive measures against
mutineers languishing by reason of heavy sickness and mortality
among our troops besieging that city.</p>

<p>Rejoining the <span class="locked">10th<a name="FNanchor_164" id="FNanchor_164" href="#Footnote_164" class="fnanchor">164</a></span> at Dinapore, that station was seen to be without
sepoy troops; the barracks formerly occupied by them deserted; the
barrack square filled with refugees from neighbouring places. Next
day the 90th Regiment, in progress up country, was temporarily
detained, as attack by mutineers was anticipated and had to be guarded
against; a considerable number of the men fallen sick, had on that
account to be landed, for they also were being conveyed by river. A
few days thereafter a detachment of the 10th arrived from Jugdispore,
at which place they inflicted considerable loss upon the mutineers, who
had taken part in the disaster to be presently noticed as having befallen
a portion of the regiment at Arrah. But continuity demands some
particulars relating to events which led up to the disaster and expedition
so alluded to.</p>

<p class="drop-cap3"><span class="smcap1">The</span> force stationed at Dinapore consisted of two troops of
European Artillery, 10th Foot, a portion of the 37th British, the
7th, 8th, and 40th Native Regiments. Among the three last named
signs of disaffection had for some time past been apparent to their
officers, though unhappily ignored by the <span class="locked">general,<a name="FNanchor_165" id="FNanchor_165" href="#Footnote_165" class="fnanchor">165</a></span> an old, infirm, and
irresolute man. On the 25th of July he was so far moved to action
as to direct that percussion caps should be taken away from their
magazines of arms, and from the men themselves. A parade for the
latter purpose was ordered; thereupon the sepoys became openly
mutinous, fired upon and otherwise threatened their officers; they
finally broke away, taking their arms with them. Meanwhile, the white
troops were not permitted by the general to open fire upon or pursue
the mutineers, who, taking the direction of Arrah, soon placed themselves
under the leadership of the powerful chief Koer Singh. Arrived
at that place, they laid siege to the house of Mr. Boyle, in which the
few residents of the small station had collected, and, to some extent,
fortified the building. On the 27th a party consisting of men of the
10th and 37th proceeded by steamer, in view to relief of those besieged;
but the vessel ran aground, and so their object was frustrated.
On the 29th a second steamer having been procured, the combined
party proceeded in her; in due time arrived at Beharee Ghat on the
river Sone; there landed, and began their march towards Arrah. Unhappily,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_112" id="Page_112">112</a></span>
a night advance was determined upon. After much toil, not
acquainted with the ground, not knowing their way, having to cross a
deep ravine or nullah, and to surmount other difficulties, they entered
the town about midnight, and after the moon had set. A heavy fire
was thereupon opened on them. Men and officers were unable to see
each other. Captain Dunbar, the officer in command, fell dead; confusion
was the immediate result. A certain number found their way
back to the open country; but so heavy were the losses, so great the
disorganization of the whole, that the expedition not only failed in its
intended object, but met with serious disaster. The remnants were
brought back to Dinapore, where they arrived on 30th of July; it was
then found that out of 415 officers and men who had started on that
service, 170 were killed and 120 wounded, making a total of <span class="locked">290.<a name="FNanchor_166" id="FNanchor_166" href="#Footnote_166" class="fnanchor">166</a></span>
The wounded who were rescued were more in number than could be
accommodated in hospital; supplementary buildings had accordingly
to be utilised for them. Throughout the regiment chagrin and disappointment
were general; stories circulated that acts of atrocity had
been perpetrated on some of the wounded. Soldiers were loud in their
imprecations against the rebels, declaring their determination “to pay
them off for it.”</p>

<p>Major Eyre, hearing of the disaster that had befallen the troops
under Captain Dunbar, advanced by forced marches from Buxar; on
August 2 he attacked and dispersed the besieging rebels at Arrah,
who thereupon fled towards Jugdispore. On the 8th a party of the
10th under Captain Patterson, together with some other troops, arrived
at Arrah from Dinapore. On the 11th, in conjunction with those of
Major Eyre, it started in pursuit of the sepoys; they had taken up a
position at a village named Jota Narainpore. There they were attacked
by the men of the 10th, who rushed upon them with a shout, killing
numbers and dispersing those who escaped their bayonets.</p>

<p>At Dinapore, Sir James Outram inspected the 10th, and having
issued orders with regard to further proceedings continued his journey
southwards, taking with him some officers belonging to the mutinous
native corps. The arrival of Sir Colin Campbell at Calcutta to
assume supreme command was followed by the departure of Sir Patrick
Grant to resume his own proper command at Madras. At Patna a
partial outbreak by the Mahomedans had recently taken place, Dr.
Lyell being killed during it. A recurrence of that disturbance being
threatened, a detachment of the 10th was sent to Bankipore as a
personal guard to the Commissioner of Behar, whose residence was at
that place.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_113" id="Page_113">113</a></span>
When the great body of the sepoys at Dinapore mutinied and fled,
certain of their number were employed on various duties within the
barrack ranges occupied by the British troops. Unable like their
brethren to effect their escape, they laid down their arms, declaring
themselves to be loyal, or “staunch,” according to the phrase of the
day; tents were issued for their use, and a neat little encampment
established on a space of open ground between the barracks and adjoining
river bank. In the course of the following night screams issued
from that encampment; in due time some soldiers, with their officers,
proceeded with lights to the tents, to find several of the sepoys dead,
others more or less severely wounded by bayonet thrusts, but without
any clue to their assailants. Whether or not, as asserted at the time,
the men of the 10th were implicated in this dastardly outrage, remained
uncleared up by the official inquiry which followed in due
course.</p>

<p>In rapid succession news reached us of events at different places
within the sphere of mutiny. The investment of Delhi more closely
pressed by the combined British and Sikh besieging forces. From
Agra that the rebels had withdrawn therefrom. From Oude that
Havelock had resumed his advance towards Lucknow, inflicting <i>en
route</i> severe defeat upon the opposing rebels. From Calcutta that reinforcements
were being daily dispatched inland by bullock trains; but
as the rate of progress of those animals did not exceed two and a
half miles per hour, considerable time must elapse before the troops so
sent can be brought into actual use. Other items of intelligence were,
that a body of Ghoorkas sent by Jung Bahadur as an auxiliary force
had been attacked by the rebels, upon whom they inflicted defeat with
heavy loss. The river steamer <i>Jumna</i> in its progress upwards beyond
Allahabad was so heavily fired upon by the mutineers, at the same
time the water of the Ganges becoming so shallow, that it had to
abandon further attempts to proceed; there was therefore no alternative
but to withdraw.</p>

<p>In the city of Patna the condition of things, already unsatisfactory,
became still more so, the intention of the Mahomedans therein declared
to be an attack on the “Kaffirs” on their great festival day of
the <span class="locked">Mohurrum,<a name="FNanchor_167" id="FNanchor_167" href="#Footnote_167" class="fnanchor">167</a></span> falling this year on 31st of August. As a precautionary
measure, therefore, a line of defences was rapidly thrown up
between the city and cantonments. Next came a report that the 9th
Irregular Cavalry, after doing good service at Delhi, had fraternised with
the rebels; with them made a dash at a besieging battery protected by<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_114" id="Page_114">114</a></span>
Sikhs, their attempt defeated by the 75th Regiment. Then sad accounts
of sickness and mortality by disease in addition to casualties in
battle among the besiegers; for example, the 1st Battalion 60th Rifles,
400 strong when it first took up its position, had not in its ranks now
200 effectives. From Allahabad the statement came that some of the
“staunch” gun lascars were detected in an attempt to load their guns
with bricks and mortar.</p>

<p>The state of things in our regimental hospital, characteristic of the
time, was this:&mdash;&#8203;In the months of July and August deaths included two
officers and seventy men. The long corridor-like wards of the building,
together with its verandah, were filled partly with wounded men,
remnants of the unfortunate Arrah expedition, partly by those affected
with diseases special to the season of the year. The requirements of
the wounded demanded much manual attention. What, therefore, between
handling wounded tissues and their dressings, finger-tips became
sodden like those of a washerwoman, and tender to the touch; the
stooping attitude necessary while performing dressings and operations
so fatigued the muscles of the back as to make it painful to be in, or
again to change that attitude; at the same time the moist heat prevailing
made such exertions particularly exhausting. The hospital had
already been fortified, arms issued, and so arranged that in case of
necessity they could be made use of by some of the patients; sandbags
were arranged for purposes of defence on the roof, the walls loopholed;
indeed, the only shots at the escaping sepoys of the 40th N.I.
were from it.</p>

<p>Rumours circulated that a combined line of action by the disaffected
in Patna and mutinous sepoys under Koer Singh, one of the
Nana’s lieutenants, was contemplated against Dinapore, garrisoned as
the station by only a portion of the 10th Foot. To meet such a contingency,
it was proposed to arm the women belonging to the regiment;
nor had those of us who had some knowledge of their general style and
prowess any doubt as to the result, should they come in conflict with
such adversaries. Indeed, there was every reason to believe that
already a mutineer had lost his life by the hand of one of our Amazons
armed with a bayonet.</p>

<p>The arrival of a Madras infantry regiment, in the ranks of which
were some Hindostanees, gave rise to some little speculation as to
possible events, should they be brought against their rebel countrymen.
At the same time news circulated that a mutinous spirit had been
shown in one of the cavalry <span class="locked">regiments<a name="FNanchor_168" id="FNanchor_168" href="#Footnote_168" class="fnanchor">168</a></span> of that presidency, and in at
least two of <span class="locked">infantry<a name="FNanchor_169" id="FNanchor_169" href="#Footnote_169" class="fnanchor">169</a></span> in that of Bombay.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_115" id="Page_115">115</a></span>
Under the circumstances of the time, welcome was intelligence by
English mail that a powerful force was in progress of dispatch to India;
its numerical strength 25,000 men, including Royal Artillery, then to
be employed in Hindostan for the first time. Now also came the first
faint rumour that the transfer of Indian administration directly to the
Government of Her Majesty was intended.</p>

<p>From Meean Meer came news of successful action against intended
“rising” on the part of native troops at that station, the attending
circumstances of that action being in some respects like those of the
historical <span class="locked">ball<a name="FNanchor_170" id="FNanchor_170" href="#Footnote_170" class="fnanchor">170</a></span> at Brussels on the eve of Quatre Bras. Among the
regiments disarmed, as an outcome of that action, was the 26th N.I.
For some time thereafter the sepoys belonging to it remained “loyal”
and “contrite.” Suddenly, under the shelter of <span class="locked">night,<a name="FNanchor_171" id="FNanchor_171" href="#Footnote_171" class="fnanchor">171</a></span> they fled, having
first murdered one of their officers. At break of day troops were sent
in pursuit; the fugitives overtaken on the left bank of the Ravee. Of
their number fully 100 were shot down, 150 or so drowned in their
endeavour to swim across that river, the remaining 200 ultimately
captured, brought back to their station, and executed. It was of the
concluding act of the drama that news now reached us.</p>

<p>In the afternoon of September 4, the <i>River Bird</i> arrived from
Calcutta, having on board the “Shannon Naval Brigade,” under Captain&mdash;&#8203;soon
to become Sir William Peel. No sooner were they disembarked
than all paraded for drill. Lookers-on rapidly collected to
witness the novel proceedings, the wild rollicking manner in which the
bluejackets pulled about and worked their ship’s guns of large calibre.
That evening the officers were our guests at the regimental mess. Our
next meeting was to be under circumstances even more stirring than
those now taking place.</p>

<p>From time to time the papers of the day gave what statistics were
available in regard to lives sacrificed, directly and indirectly, by the present
outbreak of the sepoys. According to one <span class="locked">paper,<a name="FNanchor_172" id="FNanchor_172" href="#Footnote_172" class="fnanchor">172</a></span> those numbers
were as follows, soldiers, officers, women, and children being included
in the totals; namely, Meerut, 29; Loodianah, 3; Sealkote, 8; Fyzabad,
7; Gwalior, 15; Rohnee, 1; Jounpore, 1; Jhelum, 1; Allahabad,
15; Mehidpore, 7; Mosuffernuggar, 1; Bareilly, 70; Delhi&mdash;&#8203;on the
outbreak of the mutiny, 82,&mdash;&#8203;killed or died by exposure subsequently,
40; Hissar, 9; Shahjehanpore, 1; Cawnpore, 19 (exclusive of those to
be subsequently enumerated); Meean Meer, 2; Mhow, 34; Sooltanpore,
3; Saugur, 1; Neemuch, 4; Indore, 2; Patna, 1; Moradabad,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_116" id="Page_116">116</a></span>
4; Darjeeling, 1; Futtehpore, 1; Lucknow, 22; Benares, 5; Agra,
16; Jhansi, 43; Jullundhur, 4; Ferozepore, 3; Raneegunge, 3;
Indore, 15; making in all a total of 494. These numbers do not
include the many instances in which lives were sacrificed by exposure
and hardship, nor the numerous young soldiers who succumbed while
being conveyed along the Grand Trunk Road.</p>

<p>With regard to the most terrible of all episodes,&mdash;&#8203;namely, that of June
27, at Cawnpore,&mdash;&#8203;an account by one of the very few survivors was
published in the <i>Friend of India</i>;<a name="FNanchor_173" id="FNanchor_173" href="#Footnote_173" class="fnanchor">173</a> namely, “Those who in the boats
survived from the artillery fire directed upon them were taken back to
Cawnpore; the men secured by cords, and with the ladies brought
before the Nana, who thereupon gave orders for their destruction.
The ladies were placed on one side, the men, bound as they were,
drawn up in line, and his troops ordered to fire upon them. Some of
the ladies broke away, and rushing to their husbands, clasped them in
despair, determined to die with them. A chaplain who was of the
doomed number begged that a few minutes might be granted them to
prepare to meet their God&mdash;&#8203;a favour which was granted; others called
upon their executioners to finish their bloody work. A volley of musketry;
the victims reeled and fell, some dead, others still alive, though
wounded; their murderers rush upon them with <span class="locked">tulwars;<a name="FNanchor_174" id="FNanchor_174" href="#Footnote_174" class="fnanchor">174</a></span> they deal
death around, nor do they cease their work when life is extinct, but
continue to mutilate the bodies of the dead. The women and children,
numbering one hundred and fifty-nine persons, were retained till July
15, and then destroyed by butchers employed for that diabolical
purpose. Two days thereafter, but too late to avert the catastrophe
the forces led by Havelock entered Cawnpore.” At a somewhat later
date further particulars <span class="locked">appeared<a name="FNanchor_175" id="FNanchor_175" href="#Footnote_175" class="fnanchor">175</a></span> with reference to the same sad
episode. According to them the list of persons whose lives were
sacrificed there, whether in the entrenchments between June 5 to
27, in the boats on the latter date, or on July 15, when the last
remnant was butchered, as just related, was as follows; namely,
Honourable Company’s Artillery, 61; H.M.’s 32nd Regiment, 84;
1st European Fusiliers, 15; H.M.’s 84th Regiment, 50; officers of
regiments and staff, 100; merchants, writers, and others, 100; drummers,
etc., 40; women and children of soldiers, about 160; of writers
merchants, and drummers, 120; ladies and children of officers, 50;
servants (after many had absconded early in the outbreak), 100;
sepoys and native officers sick in hospital, 20; total, 900. But there<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_117" id="Page_117">117</a></span>
is every reason to believe that these figures are approximate rather than
actually exact.</p>

<p>Orders were received and quickly carried into effect, whereby the
wives and children of men and officers of the 10th were dispatched by
steamer to Berhampore, at the time considered a place of safety. A
company of our regiment marched towards Gya, then threatened by
the mutinous 5th Irregulars, and defended only by a small body of
Rattray’s Sikhs. The withdrawal of the Treasury from that station
resulted in the official ruin of the civilian concerned; but under the
circumstances of the time the verdict of opinion among those on the
spot was that his action was justified.</p>

<p>Among the refugees proceeding by steamer down country was Mrs.
Mills, whose husband, Major Mills, of the Bengal Artillery, had been
shot by his mutinous men while endeavouring to escape from Fyzabad,
by swimming the Gogra. This unfortunate lady had been wandering
in the jungle for nearly three months. She now was ill from hardships
and starvation; one child, an infant, had died, the remaining two were
ill with cholera; she herself nearly devoid of clothing, without servant
or other help, almost completely broken down; nor was it until a few
days ago that she learned the fate of her husband. A brother officer
of Major Mills, Captain Alexander, placed a suite of rooms in his house
at her disposal. In due time she and her children were so far restored
in health, and provided with clothing, that they continued their journey
towards Calcutta.</p>

<p>For some time past a detachment of the 5th Fusiliers occupied
a building connected with the Opium Stores in Patna, the rate of
sickness and mortality among the men composing it being so great as
to equal 90 per cent. of deaths per 100 strength per annum. A
visit to the place by Colonel Fenwick and myself revealed the fact that
the quarters assigned to them were in all respects unsuited; while,
therefore, the remaining portion of the men were withdrawn, their place
taken by men of the 10th, steps were taken, and successfully, to avert
similar casualties among the latter.</p>

<p>Still there came news of mutiny from stations far apart: from Assam
on the one hand, to Ferozepore on the other; while of regiments of the
Bombay Presidency, a similar spirit had extended to at least four of their
number. Indeed, so general had mutiny become that scarcely a remark
was made as the news of some fresh outbreak circulated; but among
officers and men of our regiment the desire was loudly expressed to
“get fairly at them in the field,” little if any account being taken of
relative numbers.</p>

<p>At this time my own physical state gave way under the weight of<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_118" id="Page_118">118</a></span>
arduous duties; several brother officers also were rendered temporarily
incapable of work; but at the earliest possible date we returned to our
respective spheres, determined to “put the shoulder to the wheel.”
The good news reached us that a further defeat had been inflicted
upon the Arrah mutineers by Major Eyre. The arrival of reinforcements
by ship from England had begun to cause wonder and some
consternation among the rebels. For reasons the nature of which did
not transpire, certain newspapers were temporarily suppressed. The
immediate result of that measure was that private letters took the
place of the journals so dealt with; groups of men assembled at the
post office on the occasion of morning delivery, news was interchanged,
and thus a tolerable knowledge maintained of events in
progress at different stations.</p>

<p>From Azimghur came information that there the rebels had been
attacked and defeated by the Ghoorka troops of Jung <span class="locked">Bahadur.<a name="FNanchor_176" id="FNanchor_176" href="#Footnote_176" class="fnanchor">176</a></span> It
was said that a force consisting of 3,000 Cashmere troops, sent by
Goolab Singh, was approaching Delhi, in aid of the British, by whom
the siege of that city was being vigorously pressed on. Then came
news that on September 16 an entrance had been effected by the
Cashmere Gate; 125 guns captured, though with a loss to our troops
engaged of between forty and fifty officers and 650 men killed and
wounded. From Nagpore, that the mutinous 50th N.I. had been
attacked, and to a great extent destroyed by the column advancing
from Madras. From the Punjab, that some fifty men of the 10th
Cavalry and a number of mutineers of the 55th N.I. had been executed
by order of Sir John Lawrence. In contrast with these energetic
measures were Proclamations by Government, full of sympathetic expressions
with regard to “the poor misguided men,” as applied to the
perpetrators of deeds already alluded to.</p>

<p>A few days passed, and then came information that very stirring
events were in progress; that Delhi was completely in the hands of
our troops, the king a prisoner, two royal princes shot by the hand of
<span class="locked">Hodson.<a name="FNanchor_177" id="FNanchor_177" href="#Footnote_177" class="fnanchor">177</a></span> The forces under Havelock and Outram had <span class="locked">effected<a name="FNanchor_178" id="FNanchor_178" href="#Footnote_178" class="fnanchor">178</a></span> an
entrance into the Residency of Lucknow, and so “relieved” the
besieged garrison of that city. The story of that “relief” was everywhere
related with pride. But the fact was deplored that the “relieving”
force, as a result of the losses sustained, had itself to add its
numbers to the besieged. Among the latter, casualties by shot and
disease had, up to the date of “relief,” included fifty-seven women<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_119" id="Page_119">119</a></span>
and children. On the following Sunday, collections were made in
cantonment churches, for the purposes of a fund being raised wherewith
to aid sufferers by the present rebellion.</p>

<p>Thereafter news of successes at different points against the rebels
came in rapidly. Thus from Delhi a force had gone in pursuit of one
party of them; in Central India the 52nd N.I. was broken up by the
Madras column; near Sherghotty the Ramghur Battalion annihilated;
in the vicinity of Mirzapore a body of mutineers defeated by a small
force comprising the 5th Fusiliers and 17th Madras N.I. At this time
the “Pearl” Brigade, under command of Captain Sotheby, arrived at
Dinapore; two companies of the 10th, under Major Longden, started
towards Benares, there to be ready for emergencies. At intervals disaffection
occurred in portions of the 32nd N.I., occupying various
positions in neighbouring districts. Now came news that the last fragment
of that corps had broken into mutiny and fled; their object to
unite with the rebel force beyond the Soane, commanded by Koer
Singh.</p>

<p>Information was received that a body of mutineers 4,000 strong, with
twelve guns, was in progress from Oude to make an attack on the
Treasury at Chupra, and afterwards to threaten our small body of
effectives at Dinapore. Then we learned that Rajah Maun Singh, of
Gorruckpore, hitherto believed to be “loyal,”&mdash;&#8203;he having given protection
to some ladies whose husbands had been murdered by the sepoys,&mdash;&#8203;had
joined the rebels with a force of 9,000 men. As a counterpoise
to such items, the troops under Colonel Greathead, descending by the
Grand Trunk Road, had defeated the sepoys, inflicting heavy loss upon
them, subsequently possessing himself of Alighur, together with its guns
and stores. A significant indication of the tendency now being assumed
by bazaar opinion was that native bankers, who in the first
outbreak of the mutiny sent their treasure to Calcutta, are having it
brought back to their places of business.</p>

<p>We were at this time in a position to estimate the strength of reinforcements
already sent, and in process of being dispatched from
England, to re-establish authority in India. These comprised eleven
regiments of Light Cavalry; fifty-five battalions of Infantry; four
troops of Horse Artillery; eleven companies of Foot Artillery; seven
Field Batteries; four companies of Engineers, equal to a total of
87,000 men. With these there were fourteen medical officers, over
and above those pertaining to regiments and other bodies.</p>

<p>As each successive body of troops arrived, officers belonging to
them were invited to our mess; thus we gathered something in regard
to the tenor of opinion in England in reference to events in progress<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_120" id="Page_120">120</a></span>
around us. Very different was the impression so conveyed, of views
entertained at home, from what under the actual circumstances of the
time was to be expected. From the long distance, the sepoy was
looked upon as mild and harmless in disposition, but driven to revolt
by acts of oppression to which he had been long subjected,&mdash;&#8203;those acts,
however, not definitely stated; Sir John Lawrence and General Neil
were said to be cruel and otherwise objectionable persons; the policy
of “clemency” all that was estimable, and to be desired. The contrast
between the views so expressed, and actual occurrences such as have
been already mentioned, taking place almost before our very eyes, gave
rise to comments, some of them more expressive than sympathetic.</p>

<p>Meanwhile the progress of events went on. A body of mutinous
sepoys had found their way from Delhi to Bithoor, the residence of
the Nana. There they were attacked by a force sent for the purpose
from Cawnpore, under the command of Colonel Wilson, their stronghold
destroyed, guns, ammunition, and other stores contained in it captured.
At Raneegunge the Headquarter portion of the 32nd <span class="locked">N.I.<a name="FNanchor_179" id="FNanchor_179" href="#Footnote_179" class="fnanchor">179</a></span>
was disarmed by Colonel Burney, their commanding officer, to whom
was given up also the treasonable correspondence being carried on by
the sepoys belonging to it. At Agra the camp was attacked by a body
of rebel cavalry, estimated at 1,500 strong. The picquet of the 9th
Lancers, comprising not more than twenty-four troopers, under command
of Captain French and Lieutenant Jones, charged and cut its way
through them; but in so doing the first-named officer was killed, the
second wounded. The station of Chupra in our near vicinity being
threatened, the “Pearl” Brigade, under Captain Sotheby, R.N., was
ordered by the Civil Commissioner of Patna to proceed for its protection&mdash;&#8203;a
new experience for a naval officer to be ordered by a
civilian. At our own station reinforcements, comprising a portion of
the 82nd Regiment, were a welcome addition to our weak garrison.
Particulars were published of the cost in casualties at which the troops
under Havelock attained the relief of the Lucknow garrison; namely,
sixteen officers killed and forty-five wounded; of soldiers, 400 killed
and 700 wounded, equal to nearly one-third of the force engaged. No
wonder that in their turn the remnants became part of the besieged
garrison.</p>

<p>The party of the 10th already at Benares was held in readiness
to enter Oude, and there act as occasion might require against
assemblages of mutineers. At Jounpore, a body of rebels were
attacked by the Ghoorkas, who severely defeated them, killing or
disabling some 250 out of 1,200 of their strength. Some ghastly<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_121" id="Page_121">121</a></span>
indications of events in progress were furnished by floating bodies
in the Ganges, these being seen during several successive days, as
with vultures or other foul birds perched upon and tearing their
flesh they were carried past our station. Among them were six white
bodies, lashed together by ropes, suggesting the means by which
the victims had been destroyed.</p>

<p>By the end of October, Sir Colin Campbell started from Calcutta
to assume direct command of the troops actively engaged against the
enemy. Travelling by “dâk,” and having with him an escort of
inconsiderable strength, he narrowly escaped capture by the mutineers
of the 32nd N.I., who lay in wait in the vicinity of the Soane, his
escape being due to the fleetness of his “gharry” horses. After
that incident the same party of mutineers doubled back and endeavoured
to enter Oude by crossing the Ganges near Patna, but were
defeated in their attempt by the armed river steamer <i>Koladyne</i>.<a name="FNanchor_180" id="FNanchor_180" href="#Footnote_180" class="fnanchor">180</a></p>

<p>In bitterly sarcastic terms the policy of “clemency” towards
and sympathy expressed for the “misguided” sepoy found utterance
after this manner in the <i>Friend of India</i>:<a name="FNanchor_181" id="FNanchor_181" href="#Footnote_181" class="fnanchor">181</a>&mdash;&#8203;</p>

<p>While Peel’s “Shannon” Brigade, so recently with us, was in
progress from Allahabad to Cawnpore, it became united to the
53rd and a party of the 93rd Regiments. The combined force was
seriously engaged at Futtehpore with a strong body of mutineers, and
although successful in defeating them severely, after a conflict of
two hours’ duration, the victory was at the cost of many lives, among
them Colonel Powell, formerly a brother officer in the 57th. The
mutineers of the 32nd N.I., unable to cross into Oude, had again
taken up a position on the Soane; there they were attacked and
defeated by Rattray’s Sikhs, though not without severe proportional
loss among the latter. The party of the 10th from Benares came
in contact with and routed a body of the Oude rebels at Atrowlea.
Meanwhile the forces under Sir Colin Campbell were fighting their
way from Cawnpore towards Lucknow.</p>

<p>Martial law had for some time past existed at Dinapore. In
accordance with that effective code a Court-Martial was ordered
to assemble for the trial of a sepoy of 14th N.I., on the charge
of taking part in the massacre of our men at Arrah, as already
mentioned. Before that tribunal the man was duly tried; by it
convicted and sentenced to suffer death by being blown from a gun.
Early in the day following a strong guard of the 10th took charge
of the doomed man, to whom, in the usual way, the sentence of
the court was read. He was immediately marched to the rear of
the barracks, where preparations were complete for carrying into effect
the dreadful penalty. His step was firm, though his countenance
expressed despair and terror; his hands quivered, lips moved as if
in prayer. While being secured in the fatal position, he seemed dazed;
the heart-beat reduced to a mere flutter; a bandage tied over his
eyes, he faintly said, “<i>Hummara kussoor nahin hye</i>”&mdash;&#8203;it is not my
fault. The officiating assistant stood aside, the hand of the Provost
Marshal was raised, there was a loud report, and shreds of humanity
flew in various directions. A scene to be witnessed only under<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_123" id="Page_123">123</a></span>
compunction of circumstances. Mutineer prisoners brought to the
station for that purpose had in all cases fair and open trial.</p>

<p>Welcome was the news that during the night between November
22 and 23 the besieged garrison of Lucknow had been withdrawn
therefrom by the force under Sir Colin Campbell, and was being
escorted towards Cawnpore. At the same time accounts reached us
of the attack by the Gwalior contingent on the last-named station; of
their temporary success by reason of numbers, and of their defeat with
heavy loss in men and guns by the Commander-in-Chief. Worn out
by fatigue,&mdash;&#8203;for he was physically a delicate man,&mdash;&#8203;General Havelock
fell a victim to cholera shortly after reaching the outskirts of Lucknow.
In the vicinity of Jounpore a small British force came in contact with
the Oude rebels. On that occasion our Ghoorka allies were said to
have expressed a wish not to fight any more, and to have shown their
reluctance accordingly. Then came information that a large number
of ladies and children from those besieged, together with a considerable
body of sick and wounded soldiers, had arrived safely at Allahabad
from Cawnpore, <i>en route</i> to Calcutta.</p>

<p class="drop-cap3"><span class="smcap1">Orders</span> to take the field had been expected, and preparations
made accordingly in the 10th, so that when they did arrive all
was in readiness to carry them out immediately. Uncertainty for some
time prevailed with respect to the 73rd N.I., professedly and somewhat
demonstratively “loyal,” but known to be in a dangerous state of
disaffection, ready to sweep over the indigo-yielding places in Tirhoot,
some of the planters from which, abandoning houses and factories, had
betaken themselves to Dinapore for safety. A report spread that a
body of rebels had crossed the river Gogra and threatened the “Pearl”
Brigade at Sewan; a steamer accordingly started to Benares, conveying
detachments of the 10th and 37th Regiments, to be in readiness
to act from that base as circumstances might require. Reports at the
same time told that the 11th Irregulars had broken away from Berhampore;
that they had been severely handled by the 5th Fusiliers,
but that they were making their way towards Tirhoot.</p>

<p>By daylight on December 23, a detachment of our men and officers
was in progress of embarking on board a steamer for conveyance
towards Chuprah, at and from which place they were intended to act
in concert with bodies of Ghoorka troops for the assistance of
threatened stations in Tirhoot. Equally early on the 24th our headquarters
marched away from barracks. Arriving in due time at the
point where the Ganges was to be crossed, much delay resulted
from the incompleteness of arrangements made for the purpose.
Evening had far advanced when we arrived on our camping-ground;
tents were far behind; so were the messing arrangements. From such
“reserves” as our haversacks supplied our first meal was taken, after<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_125" id="Page_125">125</a></span>
which we bivouacked “on the cold ground,” under shelter of a
mango grove. Next day being Christmas Day, equipment and arrangements
were got into working order and ready for eventualities. On
the 26th the sound of firing, as if at Sewan, indicated that the arrival of
the 10th was none too soon, and shortly thereafter news came in that
an attack, not determined in character, by the mutineers had been repulsed.
In the course of the next few days the Nepaulese contingent
captured a considerable number of mutineers belonging to the 11th
Irregulars, but those of the 5th Irregulars succeeded in joining the
body of rebels assembled under Koer Singh.</p>

<p>New Year’s Day brought the welcome news that the rebels had been
severely beaten at Alumbagh by Sir James Outram, great loss inflicted
upon them, and four of their guns captured; also that Colonel Seton
had defeated a body of mutineers at Futtyghur. Having moved our
camp to a position north-westward of the town, we discovered a
saltpetre manufactory for the use of the rebels. Firing was again
heard in our near vicinity, indicative, as we soon learned, that our
Nepaulese allies had attacked a rebel village, which they captured and
destroyed.</p>

<p>The 10th were ordered to advance towards Azimghur, to be joined
<i>en route</i> by other regiments, the combined force to be named the
Jounpore Field Force, commanded by Brigadier-General Franks. On
the second day of our progress, at a place called Muttyala, the first
active signs of disaffection were shown by some of the villagers; it
was quickly suppressed, however, by the simple method of handing
over to the Provost Marshal those who had so acted, and having them
flogged. No further trouble with natives was experienced; and so,
without adventure, on the fourth day of our march we crossed the
river Gogra, and entered the district of Azimghur. Thence to the
provincial city our progress was cautious and wary; villages through
which our route lay were seen to be deserted by their ordinary inhabitants,
except the old and very young, by women and the infirm.</p>

<p>At Azimghur&mdash;&#8203;once a pretty and otherwise favoured station&mdash;&#8203;the
public buildings, including the church, had been reduced to charred
and roofless walls, gardens wasted and disfigured; a series of huts in
course of being erected for the faithless sepoys at the time, when on
June 3 the 17th N.I. broke into mutiny, left standing as they
then were; the gaol strongly fortified, everything destructible bearing
an aspect of ruin. Within the intrenched position at the gaol a small
force of Ghoorkas kept at defiance the rebel sepoys who had already
made two unsuccessful attacks, with considerable loss in life and of two
of their guns. Resuming our progress, the 10th reached Aroul on<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_126" id="Page_126">126</a></span>
January 26. There the various <span class="locked">portions<a name="FNanchor_182" id="FNanchor_182" href="#Footnote_182" class="fnanchor">182</a></span> of the force of which we
were to form a part united, and was organized for its prospective
duties. A halt of three days sufficed. On the 29th a march of twenty-three
miles was performed by our little army, the minimum quantity of
equipment and transport accompanying it. Several houses in ruins,
belonging to planters, were passed in our progress to the river
Goomtee; that river was crossed, and about midnight we bivouacked
on Oude territory. By break of day our force was again in motion
towards its objective point, now known to be Lucknow. That day’s
march was uneventful, except that the water in the roadside wells
was rendered unpalatable by branches of neem tree (<i>Melia Azadirachta</i>)
thrown into them by the rebels.</p>

<p>A short halt was made at Singramow, during which preparation was
made for eventualities. Intimation was there received that the rebels
were collecting their forces at Chanda, about a dozen miles in front
of us, and that their pickets had advanced to within four or five
miles of our camp. On February 19 our force was under arms at
daylight, and then began its advance towards the enemy. About nine
o’clock a halt was ordered; men and officers partook of such “breakfast”
as under the circumstances they could get, while staff officers
rode to the front to reconnoitre. A long line of rebels was seen to
occupy a somewhat elevated position at a little distance from us. Our
guns immediately advanced, opened fire upon them, their fire being
for a short time returned. The 10th&mdash;&#8203;Colonel Fenwick at their head&mdash;&#8203;threw
out their skirmishers, and thus covered, advanced at steady pace
towards the point where the rebels seemed thickest. They, however,
did not long stand their ground; before our men came within striking
distance the sepoys gave way and took to flight. Pursuit was impossible,
by reason of want of cavalry; but the small band of mounted
infantry, recently extemporised from the 10th, managed to come up,
with some of the enemy, of whom, in the language of the day, they
“gave a good account.” We subsequently learned that the forces
against whom we had been engaged comprised 8,000 men, commanded
by Bunda Hussun, a lieutenant of Mendhee Hussun.</p>

<p>It was intended that our force should encamp on the field whence
the rebels had fled. While halting for that purpose, it was found
that a second engagement was to take place; that the enemy had taken
up a position at Hummeerpore, a little distance from their former, and<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_127" id="Page_127">127</a></span>
under shelter of a wood. From there their guns soon opened fire
upon us. Ours quickly replied; a few casualties in our ranks were
the result, when darkness having put an end to the duel we bivouacked
on our ground. When morning dawned, it was seen that the position
they had occupied was abandoned; our camp was accordingly pitched,
and so we remained, prepared for the next move.</p>

<p>Resuming our advance towards Lucknow, two successive marches
of great length, and consequently fatiguing, were performed, considerable
numbers of our transport animals completely breaking down, and
so being the cause of much inconvenience to our force.</p>

<p>On the 23rd, about 10 a.m., our skirmishers drew upon them fire
from a position taken up by the rebels at Sooltanpore. That position
was attacked, and from a direction unexpected by them; thus disconcerted,
their fire was comparatively little destructive in our ranks,
nor was it long before&mdash;&#8203;having discharged upon us a volley of grape&mdash;&#8203;they
abandoned their artillery and fled, leaving fourteen guns, besides
stores and a large quantity of equipment, in our possession, also
much ammunition and loot. Again the mounted men of the <span class="locked">10th<a name="FNanchor_183" id="FNanchor_183" href="#Footnote_183" class="fnanchor">183</a></span>
did good service in pursuit of the fugitives; some of our artillery
followed, and it was said destroyed large numbers of them, the loss
to our troops engaged being again comparatively small. Thus were
the forces of Mendhee Hussun defeated, though numbering 6,000
regular sepoys and 6,000 matchlock men; the station of Sooltanpore
recovered after being held by the rebels since the previous month
of June.</p>

<p>After some delay our camp was pitched on the ground our men had
won, and we halted for a day. A party dispatched to destroy a manufactory
of gun carriages deserted by the rebels came upon various
relics, with which doubtless were connected sad and painful associations;
these included what had been an elegant barouche, a palkee
garree, and a metal toy&mdash;&#8203;the whole pertaining to victims of the first
outburst of mutiny among the troops there stationed. Near our camp
the artillery were occupied in bursting the guns deserted by the enemy.</p>

<p>On the 25th our force resumed its march at daylight, and so continued
till late in the afternoon, making one short halt to allow the
troops to draw water from some village wells, a second to cook
and distribute food. Shortly after we had started a very hideous
object presented itself to view; it was the body of a native suspended
by the feet from a branch of a tree, his arms dangling in mid-air, and
so doubtless indicating the cruel manner of his death. Arrived at<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_128" id="Page_128">128</a></span>
Mosufferkhan, where it was arranged that our camp should be pitched
we found awaiting to join us a reinforcement of Sikh and Pathan
Horse, together with some mounted men comprising half-castes and
Christians who had belonged to mutinied or disbanded regiments
all of whom had been sent by forced marches to our aid. Some stray
mutineers were discovered in near proximity to camp by our scouts
and by them duly “disposed of.”</p>

<p>A long and arduous march through difficult country; the villages
along our route deserted by their inhabitants, the fields destitute of
labourers. On arrival at our camping ground near Jugdispore, it was
ascertained that our advance guard had fallen in with and captured
two messengers conveying a purwana, or order, from the Ranee of
Lucknow to the zemindars of the district just traversed by us, intimating
to them the advance of a small body of English, and calling upon them
to destroy the intruders at Sooltanpore; also to send without delay
provisions for the rebel troops holding Lucknow. A day’s halt and
much-needed rest for man and animal. On 28th a long march, in
the course of which we passed through some villages strongly fortified
and loopholed, but deserted by inhabitants. Reinforced as we now
were by cavalry, they scoured the vicinity of our route, in the course
of their proceedings coming upon seventeen rebels, some wearing the
uniform of their former regiments, all of whom they killed.</p>

<p>With rain and boisterous weather the month of March began; it
was therefore somewhat late in the morning of the 1st when our
advance was resumed. As we proceeded, the discovery was made
by our scouts that a considerable body of rebels occupied a point at
some little distance on our flank. The main body of our force was
accordingly halted, while a portion was sent against the mutineers, the
result being that in the attack upon them the latter had sixty of their
numbers killed or wounded, and lost two of their guns. Resuming
progress, we traversed a number of towns and villages, all strongly
fortified, but sparsely occupied. Night had closed in when we reached
our halting-place. While tents were being pitched, lurid flames at
intervals in our near vicinity told the fate of villages and isolated
houses.</p>

<p>During the attack just mentioned several hand-to-hand conflicts
took place between the Sikh troopers and the rebels. In one of
these an officer received a tulwar cut which severed an artery. By-and-by
I came upon him, prostrate on the ground, alone, and bleeding to
death. A ligature was applied to the divided vessel; he was placed in
a dooly, and so carried to my tent, where he remained during the following
night. While there he was visited by some of his men, who<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_129" id="Page_129">129</a></span>
laid before him various articles of loot&mdash;&#8203;some valuable&mdash;&#8203;of which they
had possessed themselves, and now presented to him. In contrast
with an incident shortly to be related, and also in its way characteristic
of a class, the fact made an impression upon me that under the particular
circumstances of time and place, the officer alluded <span class="locked">to<a name="FNanchor_184" id="FNanchor_184" href="#Footnote_184" class="fnanchor">184</a></span> offered to
me&mdash;&#8203;who in all likelihood had been the means of saving his life&mdash;&#8203;not
one thing of the many laid out for display on the floor rug of my tent.</p>

<p>Early on March 3 the sound of heavy guns from the direction of
Lucknow told that active work was in progress there. Later in the day
a staff officer, escorted by a squadron of the 9th Lancers and two Horse
Artillery guns, arrived in camp as bearer of dispatches. These contained
orders that on the morrow our force should advance and take up
the position assigned to it in relation to the contemplated attack on
that capital. They informed us that already the Dilkhosha had been
captured. On the following day our force was accordingly in motion
towards Lucknow. It had not proceeded far when information was
received that a small body of rebels occupied the inconsiderable fort of
Dowraha, situated at the distance of a mile or so from our line of route.
A body, unfortunately, as events proved, too small for its intended purpose,
was detached with the object of effecting its capture; but with the
loss of one officer killed and several casualties among the rank and file,
the position had to be left untaken, while our force continued its march.
In the afternoon we took up the position assigned to us on an extensive
plain between Dilkhosha and Bebeepore, and so merged into the
general force under the Commander-in-Chief.</p>

<p class="drop-cap3"><span class="smcap1">Throughout</span> March 5 heavy bombardment continued, the batteries
of rebels within Lucknow replying actively to those outside
the city. On the 6th, Captain Graham’s company of the 10th occupied an
intrenched position at an angle of the Mohamed Bagh, where during the
night temporary defences had been thrown up, the task assigned to, and
successfully performed, being by their rifle fire to keep down that from
rebel guns of a battery close to Begum Serai. It became an exciting
sight to watch the enemy as they moved their guns into the several
embrasures of their battery preparatory to discharging them upon our
position, and then the effect of the volley poured into those embrasures
by our men; then the burst of flame&mdash;&#8203;our soldiers instantly throwing
themselves prone on the ground; the thud of round shot upon our protecting
rampart; our soldiers starting to their feet, pouring volley after
volley as before into the embrasures, while the guns were being
lowered therefrom to be reloaded. Thus the seemingly unequal duel
went on. After a time the rebel fire from that particular point began to
slacken, then ceased. The men of the 10th had done their work right
well. Other portions of our general force were engaged elsewhere,
preparatory to the grand attack about to be delivered.</p>

<p>Steadily during the next two days the circle of fire narrowed around
the city. On the 9th a more than usual heavy artillery fire took place
between our forces and the enemy. The sailors’ battery of 68-pounders
was engaged against large bodies of the rebels assembled among a
range of ruined buildings at the western end of the Martinière, the
men who worked the guns taking affairs with such coolness that, in the
intervals between firing, cleaning, and loading their respective pieces,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_131" id="Page_131">131</a></span>
they squatted in parties of four on the ground, and proceeded with
games of cards, in which they seemed to take as much interest as in
the effect produced by their fire. About 2 p.m., to an increased
rapidity of fire from sailors and artillery guns was added more active
<i>pings</i> of rifles, and somewhat later on the position of the Martinière was
in the possession of our force.</p>

<p>Two more days of arduous work by all ranks, the rebels gradually
but steadily being pressed in from their advanced positions; the siege
guns opening heavily upon the city; bodies of rebels in their endeavours
at flight falling into the hands of our troops, many of their
own numbers being killed. Our force increased by the arrival of
reinforcements from Cawnpore, and by that of 10,000 Ghoorkas under
Jung Bahadur, the advent of the latter causing some interest, and
not a little amusement, dirty and untidy, flat-faced, small-sized as they
were, their guns drawn by men instead of horses, their whole aspect
more suited to dramatic effect than for such work as was then in progress.</p>

<p>On March 11 the Begum Kotee was stormed and captured by a
combined force of 93rd Highlanders, 4th Sikhs, and Ghoorkas, the losses
sustained by the assailants being on the occasion very heavy in both
men and officers. In the afternoon of next day, the 10th, led by
Colonel Fenwick, occupied the position thus so gallantly won. Everywhere
around signs indicated the deadly nature of the struggle that
had taken place during its assault. Bodies of defenders, bleeding and
mangled, lay in heaps; some were being thrown pell-mell into a
V-shaped ditch, down, then up the sides of which our troops had in
the first instance to scramble, while exposed to terrific fire by the
defenders. As we entered, our artillery hastened to prepare for its
further work of bombarding at close quarters. During the night we
bivouacked within the city. On the 13th, the 10th forced its way
against severe opposition directly through the city towards the Kaiser
Bagh, while other portions of the troops were similarly at work from
other directions. Again, as night closed in after a day of most arduous
work and heavy list of casualties among our numbers, the 10th
bivouacked in streets and gardens wrested from their sepoy occupants.
On the 14th the regiment went on with its work of conquest, heavy
fire from roofs and loopholes bringing to earth, now one, then another,
and another of our men as we continued to advance. At last the
Kaiser Bagh was reached; it was quickly entered by Captain Annesly
at the head of his company, by means of a gateway first detected by
Havelock, then adjutant of the 10th; thus the central point within
the city, held by the rebels, was now in the hands of our troops.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_132" id="Page_132">132</a></span>
At a short distance from that position, and partly hidden by other
buildings, were the ruins of what had until the previous day been the
residence of the notorious <span class="locked">Moulvie,<a name="FNanchor_185" id="FNanchor_185" href="#Footnote_185" class="fnanchor">185</a></span> by whose orders, in the earlier
days of the mutiny, several of our countrymen and countrywomen
who had fallen into the hands of the rebels were put to death. As our
troops now entered the enclosure within which those ruins stood, they
came upon two gory heads of British soldiers, who had during recent
operations been captured by the rebels. The Moulvie had, however,
escaped, but was known to be in the still unsubdued part of the city,
whence he exerted command over the rebels yet actively engaged
against our forces.</p>

<p>A communication of romantic and pathetic interest now reached the
more advanced portion of our force. It detailed the fact that two <span class="locked">ladies<a name="FNanchor_186" id="FNanchor_186" href="#Footnote_186" class="fnanchor">186</a></span>
were in the hands of the rebels, their lives threatened, their position in
other respects one of serious danger; it urged those into whose hands
it might fall to press onwards to their rescue. As subsequently transpired,
those ladies were held prisoners by Wajid Ali, and by him treated
with some degree of consideration, so much so that suspicion was
brought upon him in respect to his fidelity to the rebel cause. He it
was also who sent, by the hand of his brother, to the nearest British
officer, the letter alluded to. Instantly on receipt of it, Captain
McNeil and Lieutenant Bogle, at the head of a rescue party of Ghoorkas,
started under the guidance of the bearer of the letter. The house in
which the ladies were was quickly reached; the two captives were
placed in doolies, and together with their protector escorted, not without
much difficulty and risk, to the camp of General Macgregor.</p>

<p>While these operations were in progress, one or other regimental surgeon
was constantly with the fighting line, rendering what aid was
practicable to those struck down; and here it is well to mention that
whenever officer or soldier felt himself wounded, his first call was “for
the doctor.” Nor is it to be questioned that the moral effect of our
presence was very considerable; the presence of a hand to succour imparted
confidence.</p>

<p>As soon as practicable, the wounded were withdrawn to our hospital
tents, and there their injuries more particularly attended to. While work
in front was in progress, and as a consequence that in hospital was most
active, I was on an occasion occupied during twilight in so affording<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_133" id="Page_133">133</a></span>
aid to a wounded soldier just brought in, myself on my knees on the
ground and leaning over him. A touch on my shoulder, and then in a
soldier’s voice, “Here, sir, put that in your haversack,” the action
accompanying the word, and the man passed on his way, my attention too
much occupied to observe his appearance. When work was done and
I returned to my tent, I examined my haversack; I found therein a
brick of silver, of sufficient size to make, as subsequently it did, a
tea and coffee service, the donor remaining unknown. The circumstance
is noted, as in contrast to that already mentioned, in which
an officer was concerned.</p>

<p>A visit to the Martinière revealed the effects of recent operations
against that building; statues and other works of art dilapidated,
broken, and in ruins; doors and other woodwork torn and split, walls,
ceilings, corridors injured in every possible way, large masses of <i>débris</i>
at particular places indicating those upon which shot and shell had been
most heavily directed. From the summit of the building we traced the
route by which, in the previous October, the relieving force had effected
its advance, together with some of the buildings historically associated
with that gallant feat, including the Yellow House, Secundra Bagh,
Mess House, and Motee Mahal.</p>

<p>In our field hospital the wreck of our “glorious victory” was to be
seen in plenty; officers and soldiers, wounded, maimed, or in various
instances terribly burnt and disfigured by explosions; many groaning
in their agony, others placidly bearing their sufferings, a few unconscious
to pain, the death-rattle in their throats&mdash;&#8203;all arranged on pallets, and
far less comfortably seen to than were their comrades fortunate enough
to be taken into their own regimental hospitals.</p>

<p>The streets along which the 10th had so recently forced its way to
the Kaiser Bagh presented a scene of utter devastation: walls blackened,
loopholed, shattered with shot-holes of various sizes, the buildings roofless
and tenantless except by dead bodies gashed or torn by bullets,
their cotton-wadded clothing burning, sickening odours therefrom
contaminating the air; heaps of <i>débris</i> everywhere, furniture, utensils
and dead bodies, all mixed up together; breaches made by heavy guns to
make way for advancing infantry, round shot by which they had been
effected; domes, at one time gilded and otherwise ornamental, but now
dilapidated and charred; costly furniture, oil paintings once of great
value, ornamental glass and china strewed about, and everywhere to
be seen; ornamental garden lakes black from gunpowder cast into
them; the gardens trodden down, mosaic work of cisterns broken into
fragments. At Secundra Bagh, where on November 16 some two
thousand sepoys perished at the hands of the 53rd and 93rd Regiments,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_134" id="Page_134">134</a></span>
the bones of the slain, now, four months after the event, lay in heaps, a
heavy odour of decomposition pervading the enclosure.</p>

<p>At the Residency a deep irregular-shaped pit immediately outside the
Bailee Guard marked the spot where, in the latter days of the memorable
siege, the rebels had prepared their mine against the defenders of
that position; inside and close to the same entrance were the remains
of the countermine by which the operations connected with the former
were detected, and itself sprung upon the besiegers. The door of
that gateway, penetrated and torn by bullets; buildings roofless and
bespattered with shot-marks, including that where ladies and children
spent the eighty-five days to which the siege extended, and that
in which Sir Henry Lawrence received his death-wound,&mdash;&#8203;the whole
presenting an epitome of what war implies, not to be forgotten.</p>

<p>For some time after Lucknow was virtually in the power of our force
desultory fights continued to occur at places in and around the city.
In the portions actually held by our troops, isolated men occasionally
fell by a rebel bullet. Among other casualties, two officers had the
misfortune to fall into the hands of the sepoys, by whom they were put
to death, and their heads, so report said, borne away as trophies.</p>

<p>No sooner had the principal positions held by the rebels been
captured from them than their flight from the city began, at first in
small bodies, but rapidly increasing in numbers as channels of egress
became known among them. Although without artillery, considerable
numbers carried their small arms, while others were content to abandon
everything, and seek only their own safety. One armed body of the fugitives,
while endeavouring to get away in the direction of the Alumbagh,
was fallen upon by our troops and severely dealt with; in other directions,
however, the fact became known that large bodies effected their escape
without being attacked, in places where no special difficulties intervened,&mdash;&#8203;nor
did explanation of the circumstance transpire.</p>

<p>Several field columns were immediately organized and dispatched along
different routes known or believed to have been taken by the escaped
rebels. Years afterwards the gallant services performed by one of those
<span class="locked">columns<a name="FNanchor_187" id="FNanchor_187" href="#Footnote_187" class="fnanchor">187</a></span> were detailed in a published Biography. Other bodies found
their way to the neighbourhood of Azimghur and there united with a
considerable force of their brethren, which had on March 21 defeated
a small body of British troops at Atrowlea, obliging it to retire within
entrenchments at the first-named city.</p>

<p class="drop-cap3"><span class="smcap1">The</span> task of the 10th was looked upon as finished; the regiment
had been sixteen years in India, the entire period continuously
in the plains. With an expression of glee on the part of the men was
the order received to commence our homeward march,&mdash;&#8203;that is, to proceed
towards Calcutta, there to embark for England. On the 28th
of March the regiment turned its back on Lucknow; after several
hours of weary progress it reached its camping ground. About midnight
we were roused from slumber by the arrival of a cavalry escort
and Staff Officer, with orders that the regiment should march forthwith
towards Goorsagunge, there to form part of a field force under command
of Brigadier-General Lugard, its object to raise what had become
the siege of Azimghur by the combined rebel forces just mentioned.
Before ten o’clock on the 29th our soldiers, to use their own expression,
had “done twenty-eight miles of road, heel and toe,” disappointed at
the unexpected change in destination, but also, in their own phrase,
“ready for the new work cut out for them.” Other portions of what
was to be the Azimghur Field <span class="locked">Force<a name="FNanchor_188" id="FNanchor_188" href="#Footnote_188" class="fnanchor">188</a></span> quickly reached the appointed
rendezvous, and the process of organization was complete. Then we
learned that the combined rebel force under Koer Singh surrounded
Azimghur; that a body of British, while <i>en route</i> thither from Benares,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_136" id="Page_136">136</a></span>
had suffered severely while in conflict with them; that therefore the
rapid advance of that under General Lugard was urgently called for.</p>

<p>Continuing our march from day to day, we traversed much of the
route by which our advance upon Lucknow had recently lain, it being
marked by whitened bones of men slain, ruins of villages, and huts
destroyed by fire; otherwise no event worth notice occurred until the
9th of April, by which date we had reached Budlapore. On the morning
of that day our force marched from its camp at 2 a.m., proceeding
thence direct to Jounpore, a distance of twenty miles. There information
was received that the rebel troops around Azimghur were commanded
by Mendhee Hussun, Koer Singh being present with them.</p>

<p>Men and animals, tired out by fatiguing marches, were equally constrained
to make one day’s halt. On the morning of the 11th information
led General Lugard to deviate from the regular route and proceed
towards Tigra, situated on our left, adjoining the left side of the river
Goomtee, the rebels under Gholam Hussun being reported to have there
taken up a position. A reconnoitring party speedily discovered the
point taken up by about 500 rebels with two guns; they were at once
attacked by our irregular cavalry, eighty of their number killed, the
remainder dispersed, though this small affair lost the life of Lieutenant
Havelock, cousin of our Adjutant.</p>

<p>Another day’s halt to rest our men and animals; the heat already
severe, 102° F. in our tents. Resuming our progress, our force arrived
within striking distance of Azimghur after darkness of the night had
closed in, and bivouacked on the position assigned to us, the rebels
for some time disturbing our rest by their bullets that kept dropping
among our ranks. With dawn on the 15th the several members of our
body militant were at their posts, prepared for the work before them.
As the 10th moved forward past a strip of dense jungle that skirts the
river Tonse, a smart fire was opened upon us from the thicket, as also
from a grove at some distance across that stream. The first of these
positions was at once attacked by our artillery, the infantry rapidly
following; by means of a dilapidated bridge hastily repaired, some
cavalry and artillery got across and so attacked the second. Other
portions of our force were engaged with similar activity at the points
assigned to them respectively, the result being, that after losing considerably
in their numbers, the rebels fled pell-mell, and as we entered
the city only some of their killed and wounded were anywhere met
with. It was subsequently found that they had lost some guns, much
equipage and stores, and that, under command of Koer Singh, they were
in full flight towards the Ganges.</p>

<p>When, as already mentioned, the rebels from their position in the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_137" id="Page_137">137</a></span>
jungle opened fire upon the 10th, the demeanour of our men, hardened
as they were by long service in India, and accustomed to the work of
war, was such as vividly to illustrate the advantages of having old
soldiers under such circumstances. Although taken by surprise, our
men wavered not; with equanimity our <span class="locked">Colonel,<a name="FNanchor_189" id="FNanchor_189" href="#Footnote_189" class="fnanchor">189</a></span> as he turned
towards them, said, “Steady, men, steady.” There was a sharp fire of
musketry into the brushwood, instantly followed by a charge with the
bayonet; native voices were heard as the sepoys recognised the soldiers
they had to deal with, calling to their comrades, “<i>Bhago, bhago
bhai, dus pultan aya</i>” (Run, brothers, run; the 10th have come). A
minute more, and those who escaped bayonet thrusts by our men
were in rapid flight.</p>

<p>Resulting from the day’s encounter a considerable number of dead
had to be interred, and wounded attended to. For the latter accommodation
had to be procured, as well as for our sick, whose numbers had
been rendered considerable by the great fatigue and exposure undergone
during our recent long and arduous marches. As a guard to those
so provided for, as well as to hold the city now in our power against
further attack, and leave our force unencumbered for further action,
the 34th was detailed to fulfil both duties.</p>

<p>A column under command of Brigadier Douglas started in pursuit of
the body of rebels directly under Koer Singh. They having made
a stand against Douglas as soon as the first panic of defeat had somewhat
subsided, the pursuing column was on 17th reinforced by
additional artillery, cavalry, and part of the 84th. Within a few hours
thereafter the sound of active firing told us what was taking place; then
the arrival of wounded men declared that serious work was being done.
In due time we learned that the rebels had been defeated, a hundred
of their number killed, and one of their guns captured.</p>

<p>Among the wounded so brought in was Mr. Venables, an indigo
planter, a typical representative of the rough, ready, and energetic men
who collectively become the makers of Greater Britain. Mr. Venables
had, by his own force of character, prevented open revolt in the district
of Azimghur after the 17th N.I. had mutinied, and, by means of levies
raised and commanded by himself, repelled an attack by the latter; subsequently
on various occasions he was in actual conflict against the rebels.
Gangrene of the wounded shoulder took place, and within a very short
time his death occurred, much to the sorrow and regret of those of us
with whom he had been associated. After his death it was discovered
that he wore upon his bosom the wedding ring of his deceased wife.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_138" id="Page_138">138</a></span>
She had died at Azimghur, and now his body was laid in a grave close
to the remains of her for whom his affection was manifest in tangible
form.</p>

<p>On the 23rd General Lugard learned that notwithstanding their
recent defeat the rebels under Koer Singh were advancing, as if to
threaten Ghazepore. At 9 p.m. our force was in motion towards them.
The night march was long and trying; for some hours our way was
enlivened by the clear moonlight, but the air was hot and sultry.
Occasional halts were necessary to enable the men to rest for a little,
and refresh themselves with draughts of water. Arrived at Mohumdee
next morning, several hours elapsed before camp equipage arrived
and tents were pitched, for as on various previous occasions our men
outmarched their transport train. There news reached camp that
Koer Singh had so far succeeded that nearly all the men commanded
by him had got across the Ganges; but that Douglas, having arrived
and opened fire upon them from the left bank, their chief had been
severely <span class="locked">wounded,<a name="FNanchor_190" id="FNanchor_190" href="#Footnote_190" class="fnanchor">190</a></span> and of themselves many put <i xml:lang="fr" lang="fr">hors de combat</i>.</p>

<p>Later in the day the painful news circulated in camp that a small
force, composed of men of 35th, the Naval Brigade, and some Sikhs,
sent from Arrah to intercept the rebels then in rapid flight from the
Ganges to Jugdispore, had met with disaster at their hands. The force
referred to was that under the command of Captain Le Grand, 35th
Regiment.</p>

<p>Two successive marches during the hottest period of each day, and
we were at Ghazepore. Officers and men, forced by reason of seasonal
temperature to dispense with outer uniform, wore only <i>khakee</i> trousers
and woollen shirts, the sleeves turned up for sake of comfort. Thus
equipped, dusty, and grimy, our aspect presented a sorry contrast to
the neat and in some instances elegant turn-out of men and women who
rode out from cantonments to see our force march into camp.</p>

<p>Resuming the march next morning, the occurrence of a rain storm
drenched us, but even that was an agreeable relief in the great heat and
dust heretofore prevailing. No halt took place, but throughout that
day and following night our wearied men continued what was indeed
their forced march. By daylight on May 2 we arrived at Synhee
Ghat. There, by means of steamers ready for the purpose, the work of
crossing the Ganges rapidly proceeded, and by 9 a.m. we were in the
Arrah district. We were now reunited to the column which under
Douglas had been recently sent on from Azimghur, it having succeeded<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_139" id="Page_139">139</a></span>
in preventing Koer Singh’s men from falling upon Arrah after inflicting
on a small body of our troops the disaster already mentioned.</p>

<p>Not until the 4th were all our stores and equipment transferred
to the right side of the river, and our force in readiness for further work.
The following morning our camp was pitched at <span class="locked">Arrah,<a name="FNanchor_191" id="FNanchor_191" href="#Footnote_191" class="fnanchor">191</a></span> and thus an
opportunity afforded us to visit places in and around that station with
which some recent painful events were associated. A building occupied
a few months past by a civil servant now presented the appearance of
a star-shaped fort from the embrasures of which the muzzles of guns
projected; masses of ruins told where other bungalows had been.
There stood the small fortified house, its walls loopholed and battered
by rebel bullets, a memorial of the gallant defence made by Herwald
Wake and his few comrades until relieved by Major Eyre. At a little
distance eastward from the city is the scene of the great disaster of
July 30, already alluded to more than once; the road by which our
men had marched, bordered on either side by isolated houses, at one
spot by a clump of “toddy” palms, at another by a tope of mango
trees; there the Hindoo temples at which, it was said, certain of our
men on that occasion were offered as sacrifices to Kali; there the trees
on which others were hung, though, as expressed by those on the spot,
the events referred to are as far as possible “hushed up.”</p>

<p>Information reached General Lugard that the rebels in considerable
force had taken up a position at Jugdispore. He resolved to march
upon and attack them without unnecessary delay. All extra establishment
and equipment was left to be retained in store; sick and men
otherwise non-effective eliminated; commissariat and transport suited
for service on which we were about to enter, alone set apart for the
purpose; mobility and efficiency the two qualities held in view.</p>

<p>In the lightest possible marching order our advance began on May 27.
While it was yet dark, thirteen miles of road were got over; two more after
daybreak, we then arrived at our intended camping ground; our only
incident the capture of a <span class="locked">spy,<a name="FNanchor_192" id="FNanchor_192" href="#Footnote_192" class="fnanchor">192</a></span> in the act of counting the numbers and
noting the composition of our column. The rebels had determined to
oppose us <i>en route</i>. For that purpose they took up a position in a tract
of jungle through which the road extended near Beheea; there our
artillery opened fire upon them, and thence they were quickly expelled.
The aspect of the sky portended a dust storm; it was now upon us with
all the usual violence of such meteors, the air so laden with dust
that for a time all was dark. Then came a deluge of rain, soaking us<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_140" id="Page_140">140</a></span>
completely, converting the hitherto parched ground into a swamp, but
reducing the temperature from 100° to 85°. As the sky became clear,
a strong body of rebels were observed advancing towards us. At once
a party was dispatched against them; brisk fire by the artillery, then
our cavalry dashed in among them; they broke up and soon disappeared
in the jungle. All through next night the camp was on the
alert; pickets patrolled in all directions. In early morning of the 9th
our advance was resumed.</p>

<p>During the march parties of rebels hovered on either flank, but at a
safe distance from our column. As we neared the town of Jugdispore the
enemy advanced upon us from front and flanks. When they came within
striking distance, our column, already prepared for such an emergency,
took the initiative; our men, to use their own expression, “went at
them with a will.” Before sunset that town, together with the palace of
Koer Singh, were in our possession.</p>

<p>The 10th was a day of comparative quiet; men had to rest after
their arduous work; those prostrated by heat and fatigue be attended to,
information obtained regarding movements of the fugitive enemy, and
arrangements made for further action against them. While our force
was thus enjoying comparative quiet, news reached our commander
that the rebels had taken up a position at Chitowrah, situated deep
in a dense jungle, some seven miles distant from our present camp;
that a column comprising the 6th Regiment was in a position near
Peroo to co-operate with us; that the column under Sir Hugh Rose
was steadily closing around Jhansi; and that in Rohilcund our troops
had obtained several important successes.</p>

<p>In the forenoon of the 11th a sufficient guard for its protection being
left in camp, a strong <span class="locked">body<a name="FNanchor_193" id="FNanchor_193" href="#Footnote_193" class="fnanchor">193</a></span> of our force marched to attack the rebel
position at Chitowrah. It had not proceeded more than three miles
when an earthwork across the road for a short time interrupted progress;
that obstacle overcome, a heavy fire from the dense jungle on
our flanks and front opened upon us. As a reply our artillery opened
with grape, after which skirmishers dashed into the thick forest, with the
result that they carried all before them; but pursuit was impossible by
reason of its density.</p>

<p>The heat of the day, great as it was in the open ground, was overpowering
while we traversed the forest already mentioned. It was
fortunate for all of us that this contingency had been foreseen and
provided for by General Lugard; skins full of water, carried by
elephants, camels, and bullocks, forming part of our equipment on the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_141" id="Page_141">141</a></span>
occasion. At short intervals of time and distance, soldiers and officers
indiscriminately placed themselves under the open mouths of those
skins, had their heads and clothing drenched; then continuing their
march until the hot wind effected complete evaporation, they again and
again underwent a similar ordeal. Nevertheless, many staggered, some
fell from heat and exhaustion, others gasped for breath. Considerable
numbers had to be brought along in doolies; among those so prostrated
was Colonel <span class="locked">Fenwick.<a name="FNanchor_194" id="FNanchor_194" href="#Footnote_194" class="fnanchor">194</a></span> Exhausted as we were, it was fortunate for us
that our enemies were wanting in resolution to take advantage of our
condition.</p>

<p>Wearied and fatigued as were men and officers, little in the way of
food was needed. Tea&mdash;&#8203;that ever-agreeable beverage under such
circumstances&mdash;&#8203;was about the only thing obtainable at the time. Rest
was out of the question during the night. Impressions of the day’s work,
repeated <i>pings</i> of musketry from the adjoining jungle, the thud of bullets
on the ruined walls among which we lay, the occasional arrival of
wounded men,&mdash;&#8203;all combined to banish sleep; while to those engaged in
looking after sick and wounded, whose numbers had become considerable,
their work left them worn out and exhausted.</p>

<p>Daylight of the 12th revealed to us the scene of action. In jungle
recesses mangled corpses; in the ruins, now utilised as “barracks”
for effectives, and hospital for those struck down, whether by wounds or
sickness, heavy moans of the suffering were intermingled with coarse
jests of their more fortunate comrades. The unpleasant fact transpired
that our commissariat supplies had fallen into the hands of the rebels,
while the force was engaged against them in the jungle as already
mentioned. Breakfast for men and officers became a meal more
nominal than real; orders were issued for the march to be resumed
southward, so that our force might the more effectively co-operate
with another making its way from that direction.</p>

<p>Early in the afternoon our force was on its march towards Peroo, with
a view to effect that junction. As we advanced, the forest became less
and less dense; emerging therefrom into open country, the burnt remains
of huts and villages were passed. Some stray shots reached us from
small concealed bodies of the enemy, but these were quickly silenced
by parties of our men detached for that purpose. Without opposition
in more serious form we arrived, while it was still daylight, at a
mango tope, in which we bivouacked for the night, all necessary
precautions being first taken against surprise. During that night a<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_142" id="Page_142">142</a></span>
thunderstorm burst over us; this was followed by heavy downpour
of rain, which soaked us to a degree that made sorry objects of us,
situated as we then were, and at the same time reduced the ground
that formed our beds to the condition of a marsh.</p>

<p>A raid was made upon cattle and rice, both of which were found
among some ruined huts; the former were shot, and with the latter
cooked, the meal thus provided being savoury or otherwise according
to whether individuals had or had not in their haversacks a small reserve
of salt. At dawn next morning a strong party was detached to bring in
supplies sent on to us from camp. It was not long before that escort was
engaged with the rebels by whom it was attacked <i>en route</i>, and having
defeated them, proceeded to obtain the needed supplies, with which in
due time it returned to us. As a part of that escort were some young
soldiers of the 6th Foot, recently arrived from the Cape of Good Hope.
On their arrival back from that duty they were in so exhausted a condition
that when time arrived to break up our bivouac they had to be removed
by means of bullock-carts, elephants, and gun-carriages; the older
soldiers of the same party, though much exhausted, were able to resume
the march with their respective companies.</p>

<p>In the great heat now prevailing, the distance of nineteen miles that
separated us from our standing camp was got over by ten o’clock that
day; many so exhausted that, unable to keep up with the column, they
followed as best they could, arriving as so many stragglers, but
fortunately for them, unmolested and undiscovered by the rebels.
During the absence of our column, our camp, left under protection
of the 84th, was threatened by the rebels, who, however, were easily
beaten off.</p>

<p>An attempt, made by men engaged for the purpose, to burn down
the jungle&mdash;&#8203;work in which had already cost us the lives of many men&mdash;&#8203;was
but partially successful. While at one point this was in progress,
from another came indications of attack by a considerable body of well-armed
rebels. The 10th were quickly in movement towards them, a few
of their bullets telling among our ranks. Soon, however, the enemy
disappeared in the dense forest, our men returning to the comparative
quiet and “comfort” of their tents.</p>

<p>Short was the rest enjoyed by them. On the third day an attack
from our side was directed upon two villages occupied by the rebels in
our near vicinity. Similar attacks on other villages succeeded each
other; a convoy with supplies from our base at Arrah arrived; attempts
on a larger scale than heretofore to burn down the forest were made,
but unsuccessfully; and so, with the hot season upon us, did all concerned
try their best to carry out the general work we had to do.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_143" id="Page_143">143</a></span>
Some idea of the physical condition of our troops may best be
gathered from the particulars now to be given. Soon after the middle
of May fevers and bowel disorders had become very prevalent among
them; in other ways they suffered severely from the prevailing heat and
fatigue. As to myself, according to my diary, “from the time I became
attacked at Azimghur, I have found it impossible to throw off my
illness, and now am exhausted and debilitated to a great degree by the
continued heat. Were it not my duty to hold out for the benefit of my
wife and children, I would certainly apply for sick leave.” By that time,
although our force had been only ten days in the field and jungle near
Jugdispore, the number of non-effectives was so great as to seriously
impair its efficiency and mobility; as many of these as could be so
disposed of were accordingly sent under strong cavalry escort to Arrah.
Cases of sunstroke were of occasional occurrence, though far less so
than we had expected. Our transport suffered scarcely, if at all, in a
less degree than our men, thus still further adding to the daily increasing
difficulties under which we were expected to act as an efficient force.
Another phase of our difficulties arose from the want of vegetables as
part of our food. From the day when we first took the field supplies in
this respect have been absent, the result being that men and officers
are more or less suffering from land scurvy.</p>

<p>On the 20th our force made an attack on the village of Dhuleeppore,
recently destroyed, but in the ruins of which a body of rebels had
assembled. The result of that attack was discomfiture to them,
though, unhappily, unusually heavy loss to the assailants.</p>

<p>Then followed a few days of comparative rest to our men; but meanwhile
the rebels re-occupied the position from which so recently they
had been driven. Arrangements were accordingly made for a renewed
attack on that place.</p>

<p>At daylight on the 20th our force was in motion: one portion by a
road just within the skirt of jungle, a second along the plain on which
the affair of a few days before took place. As they drew close upon
the rebel position, fire was opened from two howitzers captured on the
occasion of the disaster to the party under Captain Le Grand already
mentioned. Three rounds were fired before the 10th and 84th were
able “to get at” the rebels. Once among them, the guns were
quickly recaptured, many of the gunners killed, the rebels in flight. Our
men returned to their tents.</p>

<p>Our camp ground had become so offensive, and otherwise objectionable,
that, leaving for a time a body of our force sufficiently strong to
hold its own in case of emergency, the larger portion, under orders by
General Lugard, proceeded to take up a fresh position. The move<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_144" id="Page_144">144</a></span>
involved a march of four miles and upwards. While <i>en route</i> we
traversed the scene of Le Grand’s disaster. Isolated bones, some partly
gnawed, lay scattered about; fragments of utensils of sorts strewed the
surface,&mdash;&#8203;sad relics, in their several ways, of the episode referred to.
A halt was made; the fragments of what had been gallant men carefully
collected and most reverently interred. We then resumed our way.</p>

<p>The numbers of sick and wounded had now exceeded the capacity
of our transport; it became a matter of necessity to get rid of them, so
that the force might be left ready prepared for further action. Being
provided with a strong cavalry escort, I started with a full convoy of such
non-effectives. We traversed a piece of country directly in front of the
rebels, halting under the shelter of a mango tope during the hottest
hours of daylight; resumed the journey at nightfall, and reached Arrah
before daybreak. There the sick and wounded were disposed of in
hospital; our return journey quickly resumed, and without adventure
we were again with our force in time for further work.</p>

<p>A few days prior to the date now reached, a messenger had been
sent with dispatches from General Lugard to the officer in command of
a column co-operating with his own. The man presented a sorry
plight as he returned to camp; his nose cut off, his right hand severed
at the wrist, his face and other parts of his person besmeared with
blood, himself faint, bewildered, and dazed. After a time he related
the story of his capture. He had reached his destination without mishap,
had delivered the dispatches of which he was bearer, received
those in reply, and started on his return journey with them. While
passing through a rebel village on his way he was arrested, his papers
taken from him, he himself ordered for execution, as traitor and spy.
On the plea that in the state of mutilation inflicted upon him his appearance
would be more deterrent among possible waverers in the rebel
cause than would be the fact of his being put to death, the extreme
penalty was commuted.</p>

<p>A body of rebels having destroyed an indigo factory and taken up a
position at Kishwa, our force started at 3 a.m. on the 2nd of June
towards that point. As we approached it, a heavy though happily
ineffectual fire was opened against our ranks. The 10th marched
steadily onwards. The rebels did not long remain to permit our men
to close with them; pell-mell they fled, the Madras guns sending several
charges of grape-shot after them, the cavalry then taking up the pursuit.
We afterwards bivouacked in the open.</p>

<p>Driven thence, the rebels returned to their former position at
Chitowrah. By daylight on the 4th of June our force advanced upon
them in two separate columns: the one along the narrow jungle road<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_145" id="Page_145">145</a></span>
already mentioned; the other, under the command of Brigadier
Douglas, by the southern border of the same jungle. As we neared
the densest part of forest, in the heart of which lay that hunting seat of
Koer Singh, we suddenly found ourselves exposed in a semi-circle of
fire in front and both our flanks; fortunately without much damage to
our numbers. There was a momentary halt, then a cheer, and into
the forest dashed the 10th, trusting to their bayonets rather than
their rifle fire. The rebels fled, at first through and from the thicket
whence their attack had been made, our men following close upon
them; next, through ruins of houses and enclosures; through a
cactus hedge, across an open plain, our soldiers gaining upon them
in the race, the result being a loss to our enemies of ninety-four,
fallen by bayonet thrust of our regiment alone. Wearied and
exhausted, a short rest had to be allowed to men and officers. In
our return journey towards camp we again traversed the ground over
which the running fight described had taken place; the rebels killed
in the early part of the day were represented by so many masses of
skeletons, blood covered, some few shreds of flesh still adhering,
thus telling what had been the work done in the interval by jackals,
dogs, and vultures.</p>

<p>The immediate result of the rebel defeat at Chitowrah was that their
force divided itself into small parties, each of which seemed to proceed
on its own initiative, some as marauders, others with the apparent
object of making for Buxar, and thence across the Ganges. With a
view to act against the latter, a portion of our force, reduced as it now
was by casualties and sickness, was placed under command of Brigadier
Douglas, and proceeded on the duty assigned to it.</p>

<p>To the regret of all associated with him, General Lugard completely
broke down in health; several of the officers were ill or had been invalided;
the numbers of our soldiers who had become non-effective was
very large. Under the circumstances in which we were thus placed, the
fact became evident that unless it was intended by the responsible
authorities that our force should be permitted to melt away and so
cease to exist, a speedy return to cantonments was necessary to
preserve that portion which still existed of its component elements.</p>

<p>Great, therefore, was the relief with which, in obedience to orders to
return to cantonments, we marched away from Jugdispore on June 15.
Our first day’s march was no more than six miles long. Our men,
however, had no longer the stimulus of expected fight to brace them
up; many fell out <i>en route</i>, to come in as stragglers during the day.
Continuing our journey, we once again passed through Arrah, then
crossed the Soane, marching into quarters at Dinapore on the 19th of<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_146" id="Page_146">146</a></span>
that month. The Azimghur Field Force had done the work assigned
to it, and now ceased to exist as such.</p>

<p>The arrival of General <span class="locked">Orders,<a name="FNanchor_195" id="FNanchor_195" href="#Footnote_195" class="fnanchor">195</a></span> in which were contained the official
dispatches relating to work performed by the force of which we had so
recently formed a part, became naturally enough an event of importance
to most of us, gratification to some, disappointment to others.
Much praise was accorded to the 10th Regiment, as a whole, for
arduous work efficiently done, and special reference made to individual
officers whose services were “mentioned” in those dispatches.
Paragraph 19 of the Orders in question gave the report by Sir Edward
Lugard thus: “I beg most especially to recommend to His Excellency’s
notice &mdash;&mdash;&#8203; [myself], Surgeon of the 10th Foot and Senior Medical
Officer in charge of this force; his exertions have been untiring;
though at times suffering from sickness, he never quitted his post, but
continued his valuable superintendence. I feel more indebted to him
than I can express.” With reference to which the entry made in my
diary at the time was: “I am thankful to God for having enabled
me to fulfil my duties satisfactorily, and, for the sake of my dear wife
and children, hope advancement may speedily follow so handsome an
acknowledgment of services performed.” A few days afterwards we
had the further gratification of reading “Orders” awarding to each of us
six months’ batta.</p>

<p class="drop-cap2"><span class="smcap1">A period</span> of rest in cantonments had become a matter of
necessity to restore physical efficiency to our regiment, worn
out as men and officers were by service in the field. The ordinary
duties incidental to barrack existence in India were performed by all,
our spare time devoted to current records of events announced from
day to day by the newspapers. A few examples now follow.</p>

<p>No sooner had our force departed from Jugdispore than the rebels
returned to their former positions in the extensive jungle by which that
place is surrounded. Among the proceedings taking place elsewhere
was the defeat, by Sir Hope Grant, of a strong rebel force at Nawabgunge.
In the vicinity of Shahjehanpore, the Moulvie already mentioned
was killed by the troops of a <span class="locked">Rajah<a name="FNanchor_196" id="FNanchor_196" href="#Footnote_196" class="fnanchor">196</a></span> who had risen against his
authority. Gwalior had been recaptured; the Ranee of Jhansi killed
while leading her troops at that place against the Central India Force.
Reports of disaffection in certain Bombay regiments. In our own near
neighbourhood, a threatened outbreak by the prisoners in Patna gaol
led to the dispatch thither of two companies of the 10th. The rebels
had collected in a body of considerable strength at Chuprah, from
which position they were committing depredations on trading boats on
the Ganges; a portion of the 35th was accordingly dispatched against
them. Another party of rebels threatening Bulliah, a detachment
of the 10th proceeded by steamer towards that place. Various lines<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_148" id="Page_148">148</a></span>
of communication were kept open by parties of troops placed at
suitable points along them. The position at Arrah was so strengthened
as to be secure against attack. The arrival of a small kind of gunboat
intended for use on rivers was in its way important, as indicating the
introduction of a new means of attack.</p>

<p>At this time the issue of certain Proclamations by Government
seemed to attract much attention among the rebels still in the field;
the tenor of the one an invitation to them to lay down their arms, the
other in effect confiscating the property of landowners in Oude, with
a few exceptions. “It is all very well,” said they, “to invite us to
come in, lay down our arms, and accept forgiveness; but why make the
offer if you have the power to subdue us?” “Hitherto, if we committed
murder, robbery, or burnt houses, we were hanged, imprisoned,
or put on the roads for life; now we have done all these things, and
we are invited to accept forgiveness. Truly this is a great raj; may it
live for ever!...” Adverting to the first of those Proclamations,
Lord Canning had expressed himself: “It is impossible that the justice,
charity, and kindliness, as well as the true wisdom which mark these
words, should not be appreciated.” That is the way they were so.
The second was at once called “the Confiscation Proclamation”;
its almost immediate effect, an outbreak of hostility among chiefs
who were otherwise more or less ready to remain passive if not
actually favourable to existing law. At a subsequent date it was
cancelled.</p>

<p>The debates in Parliament on these dispatches and many other
comments on them were daily perused with great interest, not only
by ourselves, but, as we learnt, by the rebels still in arms, the several
views expressed by them somehow reaching cantonments.</p>

<p>The publication of orders, in which it was considered that services
performed by the Sikhs were referred to in exaggerated terms as compared
with the purely British, produced for the time being one effect to
which allusion may here be made. “Why,” said a very intelligent
officer of that nationality, who was well known to most of us in cantonments,
“you admit yourselves that we saved India for you; if we
can do that for you foreigners, why should we not take the country for
ourselves?” At the very time he spoke there were 82,000 Sikh troops
in British employ. It was therefore not altogether subject of surprise
to learn, as we did, that a mutinous plot had been discovered in the
10th Sikh Infantry at the distant station of Dhera Ishmail Khan.</p>

<p>Nor were matters satisfactory on the part of the Ghoorkhas, recently
our “allies.” The circumstance transpired that correspondence had
been discovered between some of the higher authorities of Nepaul and<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_149" id="Page_149">149</a></span>
the Royal family of Oude; that Jung Bahadur had expressed himself
dissatisfied with degree of acknowledgment awarded by the Indian
Government for services rendered by himself and by his troops.</p>

<p>With the advance of the rainy season sickness and death made sad
havoc among our ranks. Meanwhile a state of unrest among the
general population became more and more apparent, fanned as it
was by reports circulated among them that large reinforcements from
England would speedily arrive. Nor was that unrest confined to the
non-military sections; some of the remaining sepoys believed to be
“staunch” were said to have been detected in treasonable correspondence
with their brethren in open rebellion; that representatives of
mutineers had taken service in the ranks of the police force.</p>

<p>The 1st of November, 1858, began an era memorable in the history
of India. On that day was read at every military station throughout
the country the Proclamation by the Queen, declaring the transference
to Her Majesty of the governing power hitherto exercised by
the Honourable East India Company, the 10th Regiment and other
troops occupying our present station being paraded at the civil station
of Bankipore to impart additional splendour to an otherwise imposing
ceremony. The Proclamation was read by the Commissioner of the
district, an immense concourse of natives being present on the
occasion.</p>

<p>With reference to the portions of that Proclamation in which, under
certain specified conditions, pardon and amnesty are offered to rebels,
the <i>Punjabee</i> newspaper of October 30 publishes a return of the army
still opposed to us in Oude alone, comprising, according to figures
there given, 79 chiefs, with an aggregate of 271 guns, 11,660 cavalry,
242,100 infantry, or 253,760 men in all; an imposing force indeed,
considering that the suppression of the outbreak is declared to have
been accomplished.</p>

<p>From the rebels still in the field, various comments on the terms so
offered reached our cantonments. They considered that for crimes
committed the sepoys deserved punishment by death, nor could
they understand the exemption to that penalty now expressed. “As
an earthquake”&mdash;&#8203;according to their “prophets”&mdash;&#8203;“has three waves,
so will there be three shocks to British power in India: one we have
just had; a second will occur a few years hence; the last after a longer

<p>The arrival of papers with a new <span class="locked">warrant<a name="FNanchor_197" id="FNanchor_197" href="#Footnote_197" class="fnanchor">197</a></span> for the Medical Department
of the Army naturally enough was of considerable interest to<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_150" id="Page_150">150</a></span>
those of us who belonged to that branch of the military service. As
expressed in my diary at the time: “Most liberal it is, wiping away
at one swoop the grievances under which the Department has laboured,
and making it, as it ought to be, one of the best, if not the very best,
in the Army.” The great importance of the duties pertaining to that
department in relation to individual needs and general military efficiency
of a force was then prominently in my view from actual experience.</p>

<p>Shortly after the Proclamation by Her Majesty was read, a counter
document of similar nature was issued by the Begum of Lucknow;
but the latter produced little if any effect upon the rebels or their
chiefs, numbers of both “coming in” one after another to make their
submission. An attempt was made by a leading <span class="locked">journal<a name="FNanchor_198" id="FNanchor_198" href="#Footnote_198" class="fnanchor">198</a></span> to ascertain
the number of persons who, being convicted of crimes against the State,
had suffered the penalty of death. They were, according to that paper,
as follows, from the outbreak of the Mutiny, namely:&mdash;&#8203;By military
tribunal, executed by hanging, 86; by civil tribunal, 300; the number
shot by musketry, 628; blown from guns, 1,370; making a total of
2,384. The deposed King of Delhi recently passed our station by
steamer, <i>en route</i> to Calcutta, and finally to Rangoon, there to spend
the remaining portion of his life. The event gave rise to comment
in respect to the action of the old king against the Indian Government,
including his correspondence with the Shah of Persia in
1856; his reputed sanction of atrocities at Delhi in May, ’57; his
correspondence with Lucknow, etc. Another subject of talk was the
reported escape of the Nana, the truth of which was soon thereafter
confirmed. Lastly, the publication of correspondence between Colonel
Edwards, Sir John Lawrence, and the <span class="locked">Viceroy,<a name="FNanchor_199" id="FNanchor_199" href="#Footnote_199" class="fnanchor">199</a></span> in respect to
that portion of the Proclamation which related to native customs,
religious and otherwise, afforded ample subject to discuss in our social
coteries.</p>

<p>In the early days of 3859 came the welcome orders that all detached
parties of the 10th should rejoin Headquarters, for the purpose of
volunteering preparatory to the departure of the regiment for England.
Other orders directed various reductions to be made in military establishments
now in India; among them the withdrawal of several time-expired
regiments, and the return to their respective ships of the Naval
Brigades temporarily employed; that regiments still in the field should
proceed to quarters; brigadiers commanding columns cease to hold
appointments as such&mdash;&#8203;thus declaring in effect that the campaign<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_151" id="Page_151">151</a></span>
connected with the great Mutiny was ended. But the facts were well
known that bodies of rebels and mutineers were in the field, special
forces actually employed against them; that bodies of disaffected had
taken refuge in Nepaul. These and various other incidents were
looked upon as so many supplements to the great drama at the end of
which official orders declared that we had arrived.</p>

<p>Now there occurred an event the outcome of which to several men
who, like myself, had held distinct charges of troops on active service,
was much chagrin and disappointment; namely, our supersession in
promotion by four officers, personally good, but who, though in the
Crimea, had neither there nor elsewhere held equivalent positions.
Some little time thereafter there appeared in a service <span class="locked">journal<a name="FNanchor_200" id="FNanchor_200" href="#Footnote_200" class="fnanchor">200</a></span> a
leading article “On the partiality and injustice to the Department
exhibited in the late promotions.” This was the first outcome of
a warrant regarding which first impressions were as already recorded.</p>

<p>At last came orders for the 10th to prepare for an early march
towards the port of embarkation for England, and that meantime
volunteering should be open to soldiers desiring to prolong their service
in India. All such orders were obeyed with the greatest possible
alacrity. The usual formalities on similar occasions being attended
to, 141 of our men availed themselves of the option thus given them,
and so ceased to belong to the corps in which they had performed
much excellent work under very trying circumstances. On an intervening
Sunday a farewell <span class="locked">sermon<a name="FNanchor_201" id="FNanchor_201" href="#Footnote_201" class="fnanchor">201</a></span> was preached to the regiment
in our garrison church, and as I noted at the time, “strange as it
seems, some of the soldiers were visibly affected thereby”; but as I have
had numerous opportunities of seeing, soldiers of the period now
referred to, notwithstanding the undoubted roughness of the great
majority, had in their numbers many men keenly sensitive to the finer
impulses of our common human nature.</p>

<p>Before daylight on February 10, our regiment began its march,
“played out” of Dinapore by the band of the 19th Foot. Eight days
thereafter we encamped in near vicinity of Gyah, a place sacred to
Buddhists, and interesting in other ways. Two days more and we
were on the Grand Trunk Road. Soon at the hot wells of Burkutta,
the water of which, clear and having a slight odour of sulphur, is said
to have many medicinal virtues.</p>

<p>In observing the necessary custom on a march, of halting on the
seventh day, an opportunity was afforded those of us interested in such<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_152" id="Page_152">152</a></span>
matters, to ascend the hill of Parisnath. Occupying the eastern tableland
of the Vindyha range, itself 4,449 feet in height, like Mount
Aboo on the west of the same range, its summit is covered with small
Jain temples. Its sides are clothed with dense forests of sal (<i>Vateria
indica</i>).</p>

<p>In the course of our march, several trains of camels or kafilats, with
their Cabulee drivers, were met, as they were on their return journey
from Calcutta to Affghanistan. In accordance with the custom of the time,
they had begun their journey from Cabul eight months previous, and
hoped to return at the end of four more, thus completing it in one year.
These kafilats brought with them for sale in India, and Calcutta more
especially, fruit of different kinds, spices, skins, asafœtida, and <span class="locked">salep;<a name="FNanchor_202" id="FNanchor_202" href="#Footnote_202" class="fnanchor">202</a></span>
with the proceeds of the sale of which they purchased and carried back
with them bales of cotton goods, and others of European manufacture.
These caravans, including camels, drivers, and “followers,” presented
a picturesque and patriarchal scene, as in long lines they seemed to glide
along the road. Arrived at Raneegunge, our camp was pitched for the
last time. There a delay of several days took place, while arrangements
were in progress for embarkation; hurried journeys by rail to
and from Calcutta being made by those of us whose duty it was to
carry those arrangements into effect. A series of coal-mines situated
not far from our camp were being worked; but the industry was, comparatively
speaking, in its infancy.</p>

<p>In the early morning of St. Patrick’s Day, the regiment, stepping out
cheerfully to the familiar music appropriate to the occasion, and dear
to Irish soldiers, marched away from camp to railway station; thence
proceeded by train to Howrah, then by river steamer to the ship <i>King
Philip</i>, and so embarked. On the second day thereafter our ship,
taken in tow by a river tug, began her homeward voyage. As we
glided past Fort William, a Royal salute, fired from its ramparts, was a
gratifying compliment paid by order of Government to the departing
regiment for services performed by it during a most eventful episode in
India’s history. Wearied and worn out as our men were as a result of
those services, no cheer was raised in response to the unusual compliment
being paid to them.</p>

<p>The order by Government so alluded to was in these terms:&mdash;&#8203;“<i>The
Calcutta Gazette Extraordinary</i>, Friday, March 18, 1859. No. 360
of 1859. Notification. Fort William, Military Department. The 18th
March, 1859.&mdash;&#8203;Her Majesty’s 10th Regiment of Foot is about to embark
for England. His Excellency the Governor-General cannot allow<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_153" id="Page_153">153</a></span>
this regiment to pass through Calcutta without thanking the officers and
men for all the good service which they have rendered in the last two
eventful years: first, in the outbreaks at Benares and Dinapore; next,
as a part of the Column under their former Commander, Brigadier-General
Franks; and more lately in the harassing operations conducted
by Brigadier-General Sir E. Lugard and Brigadier Douglas on either
bank of the Ganges. The Governor-General in Council desires, in
taking leave of the 10th Regiment, to place on record his cordial
appreciation of their valuable services. The regiment will be saluted
by the guns of Fort William on leaving Calcutta. By order of his
Excellency the Viceroy and Governor-General of India in Council.&mdash;&#8203;R.
J. H. Birch, Major-General, Secretary to the Government of India.”</p>

<p>[Subsequently the officers of the 10th, including myself, received
among us nine promotions and honorary distinctions for the services
above alluded to.]</p>

<p>During the homeward voyage several deaths occurred among our
men, exhausted as so many of them were by fatigue and exposure on
service. Perhaps it was that the incidents of that service had to some
extent affected the feelings heretofore so often manifested by soldiers in
presence of death among their comrades; at any rate, it became a
source of regret to some of our numbers to observe now the indifference
shown on such occasions; indeed, scarcely was the solemnity of
committing a body to the deep finished than games, songs, music, or
dancing were resumed by parties of the men. The long rest afforded
by the voyage did much to restore health to men and officers, and in
other ways was beneficial to us all.</p>

<p>As we neared England a pilot boarded our ship. He had with him
a bundle of papers, from which we learned, among other matters, of the
occurrence of war in the Quadrilateral, full details being given of the
great battles of Magenta and Solferino. In the accounts contained
in the same papers of the state of public affairs preceding that campaign,
a probable explanation was afforded of the suddenness with which
active measures against the mutineers had ceased, and considerable
forces withdrawn from India. At Gravesend, on July 13, the regiment
transhipped to the <i>Himalayah</i>, and so was conveyed to Plymouth,
there to be quartered in the Citadel. A few days <span class="locked">thereafter,<a name="FNanchor_203" id="FNanchor_203" href="#Footnote_203" class="fnanchor">203</a></span> I had the
happiness of being with my beloved wife and children, grateful in spirit
to Providence that life was preserved through the arduous ordeal now
relegated to the past.</p>

medals.</p></blockquote>

<p class="drop-cap3"><span class="smcap1">Soon</span> after our arrival I became the possessor of a horse and
carriage, both purchased from “a friend.” With pleasant anticipations
I started on our first drive, accompanied by my wife and her
lady friend. We had not proceeded far along the country road before
the animal bolted clean away; after wildly rushing for some considerable
distance, the carriage came in contact with the embankment, was
upset and broken to pieces, the two ladies severely injured. The
accident happened at the entrance to a country house; the ladies
were admitted thereto for a little, a glass of wine given to each; they
were driven home, after which no inquiry was made regarding them.
This first experience of “hospitality” impressed us at the time, and
now is noted as in its way characteristic. We had not been “introduced”
to the family.</p>

<p>Unfortunately it so happened that among the men of the 10th there
were some who used not wisely the balance of “batta” still remaining
unspent by them. The result was that they brought obloquy upon
themselves, and to some extent upon their more steady and well-behaved
comrades who were altogether undeserving of it. So it happens
on other occasions; the actual number of men in a regiment who commit
crimes may be small, though their offences may be statistically
<span class="locked">considerable.<a name="FNanchor_204" id="FNanchor_204" href="#Footnote_204" class="fnanchor">204</a></span></p>

<p>In September attention was painfully drawn to the unfortunate failure
at Taku of the war vessels conveying the British and French ambassadors
to the Peiho <i>en route</i> to Pekin, that failure involving the loss of<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_155" id="Page_155">155</a></span>
three gunboats and 464 men belonging to them. From that moment
it became evident that troops and ships must prepare for service in the
Far East, and although, as the 10th had so recently landed, it was unlikely
that the regiment would as a whole be concerned, it was probable
that some individual officers might be so; several of us accordingly
took an opportunity of making ourselves acquainted with the current of
events in China from the date of the <i>Arrow</i> affair in October, 1856, to
that of the Taku incident alluded to.</p>

<p>Following close upon the news of that disaster came the wreck of the
<i>Royal Charter</i>, involving the loss of 470 lives, near Bangor, during
one of those autumn storms so frequent on English coasts. Public
sympathy was much aroused by these events, quickly following each
other as they did. Unhappily the last named was not at the time
isolated of its kind, though in its details not exceeded in painful accompaniments
by any.</p>

<p>A new war vessel&mdash;&#8203;the <i>Narcissus</i> frigate of fifty guns&mdash;&#8203;being to be
launched, the ceremony proved not only interesting but impressive, in
respect to sentiments it evolved. An immense assembly met by invitation
in Devonport Dockyard to witness the event; as the hour of four
struck, the beautiful ship glided amidst a round of cheers into what
thenceforward was to be her proper element; her career in the future
in that respect like the career of the new-born infant&mdash;&#8203;uncertain, beset
by risks.</p>

<p>Very different in character was another “function” at which I
“assisted”; namely, a lecture with demonstrations on phrenology, the
“correctness” of that “science” being illustrated by the lecturer by
references to the characteristics of the Hindoo in respect to mildness,
gentleness, and tractability. To those of us recently returned from
scenes already described, his remarks and demonstrations seemed
outcomes of misapplied knowledge. Yet, such as they were, they
“went down” with the enlightened British public, as represented by
that particular audience.</p>

<p>Various circumstances, domestic and foreign, combined to render
regimental life one of uncertainty, at the particular time now referred
to. In India more than one column of our forces were actively
engaged against the rebels who declined the terms of the gracious
Proclamation already mentioned. The recently enlisted men for so-called
“European” regiments of the late East India Company had
combined in what was called “The White Mutiny”; they were
shipped to England, there to be discharged the <span class="locked">service.<a name="FNanchor_205" id="FNanchor_205" href="#Footnote_205" class="fnanchor">205</a></span> Disaffection<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_156" id="Page_156">156</a></span>
had appeared in two native cavalry regiments stationed at
<span class="locked">Hyderabad.<a name="FNanchor_206" id="FNanchor_206" href="#Footnote_206" class="fnanchor">206</a></span> With regard to Europe, the condition of affairs in and
relating to Italy was disturbed and uncertain. In France, the effusions
of certain Colonels, added to other indications hostile to England,
seemed to have an unpleasant significance, more especially that in
which an appeal was made to the Emperor “to give the word, and
the infamous haunt in which machinations so infernal are planned”&mdash;&#8203;namely,
London&mdash;&#8203;“should be destroyed for ever.”</p>

<p>A strong fleet of combined English and French warships proceeded
to China. Extensive stores and supplies of all kinds were shipped
for that destination, magazines were replenished; appearances indicated
that important operations were in the near future. Uncertainty
and speculation regarding probable events pervaded all ranks pertaining
to regiments now available for emergent service; all held themselves
prepared accordingly.</p>

<p>Various Militia regiments, embodied during the Crimean War, still
occupied barracks throughout England; at Devonport and Plymouth
the Warwickshire and Dublin Regiments, together with the Forfar
Militia Artillery, being quartered. Second battalions were in progress
of being added to the twenty-five first of the line. Now also, for the
first time since the Revolutionary War, regiments of Volunteers were
being rapidly formed. So important was the occasion considered to be
that special invitations were issued to witness in the Town Hall the
first parade of the Volunteers belonging to what were called “The
Three Towns,” and to inaugurate the formation of the regiment so constituted.
The building was well filled by officials and others; great
was the enthusiasm with which the ceremony passed off, the numbers
of Volunteers in the ranks of the new regiment being ninety-three.</p>

<p>Some changes, having for their object the improved condition of the
soldier, were now in course of introduction. Thus orders were issued
on the subject of corporal punishment, the infliction of which was
reduced to a minimum. In other respects the stringent methods heretofore
considered necessary for the maintenance of discipline were so
relaxed that old officers were wont to predict a number of evil consequences
as sooner or later sure to follow.</p>

<p>With the introduction of the national system of education into regimental
schools, the reading of the Holy Bible in them was looked
upon as seriously menaced in the present and threatened with prohibition
in the near future. According to orders issued on the subject,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_157" id="Page_157">157</a></span>
“the Bible is only to be read, and religious instruction of any kind
given, during one hour per week, and then in the presence of the
Roman Catholic priest.” Many among us looked with dread and
apprehension to the probable outcome of the changes so begun.</p>

<p>That in the large garrison of Plymouth and Devonport there existed
no regular hospital for the wives and children of soldiers seemed to
most of us a very anomalous circumstance. Correspondence on the
subject between myself and the Divisional authorities was without
practical result. Taking advantage of the popularity and influence of
Miss Nightingale at the War Office, I addressed myself to that lady.
In a marvellously short space of time orders were received to set on
foot such an establishment; they were quickly carried out, very much
to the benefit of the classes for whom it was intended.</p>

<p>On January 15, 1860, I received a letter from the Registrar of
the Bath, directing me to hold myself in readiness to proceed to
Windsor, there to receive the Insignia of that Order, to which I had
some months previously been <span class="locked">gazetted.<a name="FNanchor_207" id="FNanchor_207" href="#Footnote_207" class="fnanchor">207</a></span> Two days thereafter&mdash;&#8203;namely,
on the 17th&mdash;&#8203;a further letter ordering my attendance at Windsor Castle,
at quarter before 3 p.m. precisely, on the 19th. On the 18th I proceeded,
taking my dear wife with me, to that Royal burgh. The
early part of the forenoon of the 19th was occupied in visiting some of
the points of interest connected with the Castle, more especially the
Round Tower and St. George’s Chapel, the latter containing that most
beautiful work of art, the cenotaph to the Princess Charlotte.</p>

<p>Punctually at the hour appointed, those of us who were to be similarly
honoured drove to the Castle. We were shown into the Oak
Room, and there, taking count of each other, discovered that our party
numbered fourteen. Luncheon over, a messenger announced that
Her Majesty was ready to begin the ceremony of investiture. The
Lancaster <span class="locked">Herald,<a name="FNanchor_208" id="FNanchor_208" href="#Footnote_208" class="fnanchor">208</a></span> who had meantime very courteously initiated some
of us in the formalities to be observed, then mustered us in our order.
He led the way, we following, into the great corridor, at a door
opening into which we were halted, to be called in our turn to the
Royal presence. The first to enter was an officer upon whom the
honour of knighthood was to be conferred. Each Companion was
summoned in his order of seniority as such. The cross with which we
were severally to be invested was by the Lancashire Herald carried
upon a cushion of crimson velvet. The door being opened, we
separately entered a small apartment, at the further end of which stood<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_158" id="Page_158">158</a></span>
the Queen; at her right side the Prince Consort. Our names
announced, we advanced, making obeisance as we did so, knelt upon
the right knee; the cross was attached over to the left breast by Her
Majesty; we kissed hands, retired backwards, profoundly bowing the
while. Thus we emerged, and the ceremony was <span class="locked">over.<a name="FNanchor_209" id="FNanchor_209" href="#Footnote_209" class="fnanchor">209</a></span></p>

<p>Preparations on a large scale for the expedition to China were in
rapid progress, the military forces to be sent thither comprising regiments
direct from England, others, British and native, from India.
Public attention and a good deal of adverse criticism were directed to
what was looked upon as excessive naval and military estimates in a
so-called time of profound peace. At important military and naval
stations, fortifications were much extended, and newly armed with
Armstrong guns; for, although there was much of what was ludicrous in
the “boastings of the French Colonels,” the fact was apparent that
their expressions were not altogether unnoticed by our authorities.</p>

<p>Excursions in various directions were taken; some with the object of
seeing places of historical interest, some to take note of the early
spring flora, others to examine geological features of the neighbouring
country. One such visit was to copper mines near Liskeard, there
to see for the first time the beautiful “peacock” ore brought from
the depths of earth and displayed to our gaze by means of a hammer
wielded by the sturdy arms of “Captain Jane,”&mdash;&#8203;for the superintendent
of the mine was a woman so named.</p>

<p>At a little distance from the Canadian and Phœnix mines rises the
Cheesewring, a granite hill some 1,200 feet in height, the rocks on its
summit so piled upon each other as to thus give rise to its particular
name. On some of those rocks were marks of boulder action, also
tracings that bore distinct resemblance of vessels in ordinary use by
Hindoos at their worship on the banks of the Hooghly, and now attributed
to the Druids, one of whose places of sacrifice this <i>tor</i> may
perhaps have been.</p>

<p>More and more did the state of uncertainty and unrest in which
regimental officers had to perform their duties increase during the
early months of the year, by the condition of affairs in Continental
Europe. With regard to items of the general complication then noted,
the following extract from my diary, written at the time, reads somewhat
strangely to-day, namely: “France resolved upon the annexation
of Savoy, notwithstanding the strongly expressed opposition of England
against that measure; the threatened occupation of Tetuan by Spain,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_159" id="Page_159">159</a></span>
opposed by England, as being against the terms on which England
remained neutral between that country and Morocco.”</p>

<p>The first decade of wedded life <span class="locked">completed,<a name="FNanchor_210" id="FNanchor_210" href="#Footnote_210" class="fnanchor">210</a></span> the following reference to
the occasion was written at the time: “Notwithstanding all that I have
undergone since that event, sufficient of my early romance remains to
enter in this place the motto which on that occasion surrounded the
bon-bon broken by my bride and myself at our wedding luncheon&mdash;&#8203;‘My
hopes are in the bud; bid them bloom.’” As the paragraph is
being transcribed, the fifth decade is not far from completion. With
affection chastened and sanctified by trial and affliction, I express to
the Almighty humble gratitude that from bud my hopes have indeed
advanced to bloom&mdash;&#8203;holy and refined.</p>

<p>Towards the end of April, soldiers and officers of the 10th received
their medals awarded for the campaign connected with the Indian
Mutiny. No pomp and circumstance of military display took place on
the occasion of their doing so. On the contrary, from the manner in
which the distribution took place, all such accompaniments were intentionally
avoided. It was while walking on the public thoroughfare in
Devonport, that by accident, as it were, I met a sergeant in whose
hand was a packet of little card-case boxes; one of these he presented
to me&mdash;&#8203;it contained my medal. I then continued on my way!</p>

<p class="drop-cap3"><span class="smcap1">On</span> April 26 I had the unlooked-for surprise to receive a demi-official
letter from the Departmental Office, warning me for service
in China on promotion. The note of the circumstance recorded in
my diary at the time was this: “Bitter has been my disappointment on
being superseded. In my turn I am now to supersede others; but the
system is not the less cruel to those who suffer by it.” The promotion
so indicated implied that I was about to pass over an entire <span class="locked">grade,<a name="FNanchor_211" id="FNanchor_211" href="#Footnote_211" class="fnanchor">211</a></span>
including its members, all of whom are my seniors in the service.</p>

<p>Short was the time allowed to make arrangements for my dear wife
and children, from all of whom I took leave on May 2. On the following
day I received further orders in London, and proceeded to
Southampton; on 4th embarked on board the P. and O. steamer
<i>Ripon</i>; by 2 p.m. we were on our voyage.</p>

<p>The “Overland” route was now before us, its attractions and incidents
new to me. The bold coast scenery of Portugal, towns, forts,
and convents succeeded each other at short intervals; Mondego Bay;
Mafra, near to which the “lines” of Torres Vedras were begun, by
England’s great commander. Then the Spanish coast with its vineyards
and olive groves, villages and hamlets; Tarifa, at the siege of
which by the French, in 1811&ndash;12, the 87th Regiment gained distinction
by repelling the assailants under General <span class="locked">Laval,<a name="FNanchor_212" id="FNanchor_212" href="#Footnote_212" class="fnanchor">212</a></span> the old Moorish walls
of that town being clearly seen by us. Now came into view, on our
right, Ceuta, far away behind which rose peaks of the Atlas range; the
great rock and fortress of Gibraltar, between it and Africa the “gut”
some twelve miles broad; then we are in the comparatively wide expanse<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_161" id="Page_161">161</a></span>
of the “blue Mediterranean.” Rising to a height of 11,000
feet, the Sierra Nevada, white with snow and magnificent in outline on
our left, the chilly breezes from which now swept across our track.
Next, passing close by the Cane rocks, where since the previous
January a lighthouse was established; then the sight of the Gulf of
Tunis carried historical associations back to Carthage and its wars.
The island of Pantellaria, pretty to view from the distance, but as a
penal settlement for Sicilian convicts, it is in all probability less agreeable
as a place of residence. Then, on our right, Gozo, the cultivated
terraces on which could be distinctly seen through our binoculars;
otherwise the island looked treeless and bare, the most prominent
objects upon it a succession of fortifications, for it is garrisoned by
British troops. Yet, bare as it seems, Gozo is said to be a “garden”
whence fruit and vegetables are chiefly supplied to Malta. Now we
approach that island, the densely crowded town of Valetta comes in
sight; we enter the harbour, ramparts and bastions on either side of
us, the monotony of the town buildings interrupted by spires and
pinnacles; every building dazzling white. As the anchor drops, we
know that our stay is to be brief; a hasty run ashore, a visit to St.
John’s Cathedral, the Armoury, one or two other places of interest,
then we resume our journey eastward.</p>

<p>Alexandria was our next point of interest. As in the early hours of
morning we approached that historical port and city, the lighthouse, the
numerous windmills along the shore line, were the distinctive objects first
seen; as we entered the harbour, the Lazaretto, seraglio and palace of
the Sultan were on our left. Ships of all nations, but the majority
British, swing at anchor in our near proximity. A steamer conveyed us
to the railway station, whence by train to Cairo, passing on our way an
extensive line of ruins of the ancient aqueduct of Alexandria, destroyed
by Diocletian, <span class="smcap smaller">A.D.</span> 296; the station of Meyrout, the name indicating
Mæotis, the lake or reservoir so named being indicated by a succession
of shallow pools, on some of which “sportsmen” were engaged in shooting
water-birds of sorts; then the windings of the Mahmoodieh Canal to
our left; fields of bearded wheat and barley ready for the sickle, while
in some few places “thrashing floors” were extemporised, oxen unmuzzled
engaged on them, as in the days of the patriarchs. Crossing
the Nile at Kafr ez Zajyat, the first glimpse of that sacred stream was
obtained; then the Pyramids of Ghizeh came in view, recalling to
our minds many associations connected with their wonderful history;
then early in the afternoon we were at Cairo.</p>

<p>El Kahira, “the Beautiful”! Under the guidance of a dragoman from
the hotel where a brief stay was made, we started to explore the city.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_162" id="Page_162">162</a></span>
Winding our way through narrow streets, named respectively the Turkish,
French, and Greek Bazaars, opportunity was given to observe the manners
and strange variety of persons and costumes in those places.
Having visited various smaller mosques, we ascended to the Citadel,
the work of Saladin, <span class="smcap smaller">A.D.</span> 1176, but interesting not so much in itself
as for the famous mosque of alabaster contained within it, that edifice
erected by Mahomed Ali, and now forming his tomb. The portion
of the citadel wall whence, on the occasion of the massacre of
the Mamelukes by order of that monarch in March, 1811, Emir Bey
leaped his horse to a depth of 60 to 80 feet, then succeeded in effecting
his escape, was carefully scanned. At a little distance from it we
stood in the palace yard in which 700 doomed Beys, having been
treacherously invited to a pretended marriage, were shot down from
loopholes around, while in a window pointed out to us the Pasha sat
looking on, and quietly enjoying his chebouk. From the walls we
readily followed by the eye the Nile, winding and flowing smoothly on as
in the days of the Pharaohs. Green with vegetation was the island of
Rhodda, upon which, <span class="smcap smaller">B.C.</span> 1517, the infant Moses was found by Thermuthis,
the king’s <span class="locked">daughter;<a name="FNanchor_213" id="FNanchor_213" href="#Footnote_213" class="fnanchor">213</a></span> in the distance the plain of Bussateen, upon
which tradition records that the Israelites encamped in the first day of
their flight. Further away were the Pyramids of Sakarah and Dahshur.
Beyond them the haze seemed to blend with the desert.</p>

<p>Next day the passengers <i>via</i> Marseilles arrived, and the whole party
of us resumed our journey. It was not long until our train had entered
the desert, extending far as the eye could reach; in some places
varied by sandhills of different sizes, in others flat, but everywhere
destitute of vegetation save a few stunted bushes. In the bright sunshine
the mirage glittered deceptively, presenting the appearance of
sea and islands, to vanish in their turn as we approached them. A
few short halts at stations, and we detrain at Suez, to resume our
journey by sea; we have completed the “overland” portion of it.</p>

<p>Suez, supposed to be the ancient Arsinoe, was interesting for the
reason that in our approach thereto we had an opportunity of observing
the line of retreat assigned by tradition to the Israelites in their flight
from their oppressors. But now our movements were hurried; we
were quickly on board the <i>Colombo</i>, ready waiting for us in the gulf,
and so away we steamed towards the Red Sea.</p>

<p>Our progress was uneventful during the five days occupied in traversing
that much-dreaded track. The temperature of air and sea rose
to a higher point than we had yet experienced; the numerous islands,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_163" id="Page_163">163</a></span>
the greater number destitute of lighthouses, were material proofs of
dangers to navigation by night&mdash;&#8203;a danger rendered the more significant
as we steamed close past a rock on which a P. and O. <span class="locked">vessel<a name="FNanchor_214" id="FNanchor_214" href="#Footnote_214" class="fnanchor">214</a></span>
had shortly before been wrecked. As we passed the position of Mocha,
binoculars revealed to us the white houses, minarets, pillars, and balconies
of that Arabian town.</p>

<p>The rock of Aden, bare, rugged and unattractive in appearance, rose
before us; in due time we were at anchor in the bay. The usual rush
ashore was not indulged in, because of the great heat prevailing, nor did
we look with envy upon the few residents who took their afternoon drive
along the strand, our own amusement consisting in throwing small coins
into the sea, and seeing the great agility of young Arabs as they dived
after and caught them.</p>

<p>In the early morning of June 4, our ship arrived in Galle harbour,
the view as we entered rich and beautiful, the hills on either side
and in front thickly covered with palms and under vegetation, but the
heavy hot atmosphere causing a sense of great oppression. The south-west
monsoon was at full strength, the sea beating in heavy breakers
over some rocks at the harbour. As we entered we came close to the
wreck of the <i>Malabar</i>; that vessel, while starting from her anchorage a
few days previous, having on board the English and French Plenipotentiaries
to China, was driven upon a rock, and wrecked by the heavy
weather prevailing. Here we had to tranship to the <i>Pekin</i>, to continue
by that vessel our voyage eastward. While so delayed, we indulged in the
usual drives to places in the neighbourhood, everywhere through dense
forests of palms, alternated with those of other tropical forms, the atmosphere
hot, damp, and oppressive. The Cinnamon Gardens, so named
from what was formerly a principal product of the island, were in a state
of neglect and decay; the cinnamon industry a thing of the past, like
that of the nutmeg, at one time prosperous while as yet Ceylon was
Dutch property; nor was the cultivation of coffee a success by British
planters, the shrub which yields that berry being attacked by insect and
vegetable blights, the general result being ruin to nearly all interested
in its cultivation.</p>

<p>The accident referred to led to the rescued passengers from the
<i>Malabar</i> being sent on board the <i>Pekin</i>, and our ship was crowded to a
degree that speedily became unpleasant. As we steamed across the Bay
of Bengal in heavy monsoon weather, the ports had to be closed. Then it
was that, in addition to the sweltering atmosphere “below,” emanations
from opium, that drug being the chief portion of the ship’s cargo, affected<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_164" id="Page_164">164</a></span>
us unpleasantly, first by the sense of taste, then by exerting to some
extent its narcotising influence; it was therefore a most welcome relief to
us, as we approached Sumatra, to get into clear weather, to have everything
thrown open, and so enjoy the delightful change that had taken
place in our condition.</p>

<p>Our next point was the high and thickly wooded island of Penang.
Our ship having dropped anchor, several of our party started to “explore”
that very lovely island. We drove along well-made roads, on either side
bordered with bamboo hedges, through which flowering creepers stretched
or hung in festoons. Bungalows, each in its well-kept garden, in which
grew palms, tropical fruit trees, and flowers, were thickly dotted about;
an extensive field of “pawn” pepper, then groves of nutmeg trees were
passed, and we arrived at the object of our excursion, the cascade, 140
to 160 feet high. Here, for the first time, we indulged in that delicious
fruit the mangosteen.</p>

<p>Arrived at <span class="locked">Singapore,<a name="FNanchor_215" id="FNanchor_215" href="#Footnote_215" class="fnanchor">215</a></span> the busy aspect of the town, with its population
of 70,000, chiefly Chinese, impressed us. We noted with interest the
numerous temples connected with the sects into which that population
is divided. In the course of a ramble taken for purposes of discovery
we were accosted by a Chinaman. He addressed us rudely; laughing and
gesticulating as he spoke, he said, “Plenty English going to China; they
will soon be all shot;” thus expressing his own views and probably also
his desire in regard to the issue of the war. Among a great variety of
articles publicly exposed for sale were two small pieces of ordnance;
nor could the sale of such weapons be interfered with, as no Declaration
of War had so far been made. While our ship, the <i>Pekin</i>, remained in
harbour, some of our number paid their respects to His Excellency the
Governor&mdash;&#8203;namely, to Colonel Cavanagh&mdash;&#8203;whose story at Maharajpore
has already been recorded.</p>

<p>On various occasions during this part of our voyage, opportunity
brought us in contact with the representatives of France and England,
our fellow-passengers. Baron Gros was generally reserved in manner;
Lord Elgin, on the contrary, frank and open. The latter expressed his
views that an advance on Pekin had become a matter of necessity; in
his negotiations with the Chinese, he meant to ask only for what is reasonable
and just, and having done so to obtain it; but not to take
advantage of one concession to base upon it a demand for another. He
was of opinion that the season was too far advanced to permit of further
proceedings than the capture of the Tientsin forts, as a base of operations
for the ensuing spring; some of the islands in the Gulf of Pehchili being<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_165" id="Page_165">165</a></span>
taken possession of to serve as sanatoria. He observed, with reference
to the existence of the Taiping rebellion, that if on the one hand the
influence of the Court at Pekin were to be seriously weakened, the
schemes of the rebel party would be thereby assisted; while on the other
hand severe chastisement was necessary as retribution for treacherous
action against our ambassadors and their ships at Taku. Therefore,
the difficulty to be overcome was to punish and yet not seriously
injure the Imperial power. But events were to outrun the anticipations
so expressed.</p>

<p>Hong-Kong was reached on Midsummer Day. As the town of Victoria
came in sight, the general aspect presented by it produced a favourable
impression upon us; the light and airy style of houses rising in tiers
above each other upwards along the precipitous mountain face, that
mountain culminating in a peak some 1,500 feet above sea level, presented
a panorama different altogether in character from anything we
had hitherto seen. The circumstance that the town and the roads where
the shipping lay were completely sheltered from the south-west monsoon
then prevailing furnished full explanation for the oppressive damp
heat to which we were at once <span class="locked">introduced.<a name="FNanchor_216" id="FNanchor_216" href="#Footnote_216" class="fnanchor">216</a></span> It became my painful duty
to announce myself to the officer, who, by the fact of my arrival, was
superseded in his position, with whom in his disappointment and
chagrin I much <span class="locked">sympathised.<a name="FNanchor_217" id="FNanchor_217" href="#Footnote_217" class="fnanchor">217</a></span> Indeed, so greatly did he feel what he
looked upon as the disgrace into which he had departmentally fallen,
that his subsequent career was unfortunate; nor did he ever return to
England.</p>

<p class="drop-cap3"><span class="smcap1">The</span> expeditionary force had already sailed northward, its equipment
and appliances on a scale of completeness unknown prior
to the recent Royal Commission. Before that expedition started, all
non-effectives, whether by sickness or other causes, were eliminated;
what was called a Provisional Battalion was organized for their reception,
as well as for that of newly arrived reinforcements from home to
fill expected “waste” among those actively engaged. The ordinary
barrack accommodation at Hong-Kong being insufficient, huts were
erected at various points, among others on the peak called Victoria;
a large vessel in harbour fitted up for hospital purposes, and vessels
engaged, as necessity arose, for the transport of invalids to the Cape of
Good Hope and England.</p>

<p>Among the non-effectives left by the &mdash;&#8203;st Regiment was an officer
now indicated by the initial M&mdash;&mdash;&#8203;. At his request I visited him, in
company with his medical attendant. It was evident at a glance that
he was extremely ill, his life rapidly ebbing away. He addressed me
after this manner: “I have asked you to see me that you might tell me
what you think of my state.” To my inquiry, “Are you prepared to
receive my answer?” he replied, in impatient tones: “If I were not,
I would not have asked the question.” “I am sorry, then, to believe
that you have but a very short time to live,” was my remark. “I
thought as much. Do you see that packet on my chest of drawers? I
want you to take it away with you; as soon as I am dead, to burn it unopened
in your own room.” Such was his request, and so far I acceded
to it. The following morning M&mdash;&mdash;&#8203; was dead; his packet burnt as
he had desired. A sequel to this incident will be mentioned hereafter.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_167" id="Page_167">167</a></span>
In the words of a newspaper <span class="locked">correspondent,<a name="FNanchor_218" id="FNanchor_218" href="#Footnote_218" class="fnanchor">218</a></span> the island of Hong-Kong
may be compared to a beautiful woman with a notoriously bad
temper,&mdash;&#8203;to be admired from a distance, but not become intimately acquainted
with. At the date of our arrival the midday heat, as gauged
by our sensations, was great; the sky cloudless, exercise or duty out of
doors very trying, a sensation of sickness experienced in a way altogether
different from what was felt in India. Early in July the rainy
season began. Quickly a series of waterfalls poured over rocky
promontories; Victoria Peak was enveloped in mist; temperature moderated,
the general conditions became bearable. So they continued till
September; intervals of rain and sunshine alternated with each other.
Unhappily endemic forms of disease went on steadily increasing in
prevalence and rates of mortality. A favourable change took place in
all these conditions as the last-named month advanced, and progressed
till the cold season fairly set in.</p>

<p>The portion of the force with which I was immediately concerned
included British and native Indian troops, the latter belonging to the
three several presidencies of that Dependency. Each of these bodies
had its own code of Regulations, in accordance with which routine
duties were conducted, while all of them seemed unwilling to accept
those of the Imperial service, under which alone administration of the
expeditionary force had of necessity to be conducted.</p>

<p>Another difficulty in which I was personally affected seemed to arise
from the circumstance that some of the instructions under which my
duties in relation to shipping had to be conducted were special, while
those under which the naval authority on the spot conducted his department
were general. Unhappily a good deal of friction was the
outcome of this state of things, all of which might have been possibly
avoided had mutual explanation been given in respect to the particular
orders under which we were severally acting. It seems to me, also,
while I refer to what was very unpleasant at the time of its occurrence,
that in many circumstances connected with public duties where misunderstandings
arise, they would be most readily prevented by
means of elucidation of the points of view from which divergent action
is taken, or the interpretation of orders from which it is adopted.</p>

<p>As an example of the system of “red tape” under which duties of
very ordinary description had to be carried on, the following may be
mentioned:&mdash;&#8203;A water-pipe connected with the military hospital went
wrong; the supply through it had to be cut off, to the very great
inconvenience of the sick. I at once reported the circumstance to the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_168" id="Page_168">168</a></span>
Officer in command of the garrison, such being the routine directed by
Regulations, requesting at the same time that immediate steps should
be taken to make the required repairs. My letter was by the Commanding
Officer transmitted to the Engineer Officer, who forwarded it
to the Clerk of the Works, who came and inspected the defect in the
pipe, then wrote a report about it to the Engineer Officer, who sent
the report to the Commanding Officer, who sent to the Town Major,
who sent it to me. Meanwhile, the hot season being at its height, and
nothing actually done to remedy the defect complained of, I was constrained
to again start the correspondence by observing that what was
urgently required was, not reports, but that the damaged pipe should
be repaired. Doubtless my letter to that effect had, like its predecessor,
to be transmitted through the series of “channels” so enumerated.
I quite forget at this distance of time whether the pipe was
ever repaired or not.</p>

<p>The circumstance that a portion of our force occupied quarters at
Canton led me to visit that important city. The steamer by which the
trip thither along the Pearl River was performed bore the romantic
name <i>The White Cloud</i>. We passed the Bocca Tigris or Bogue <span class="locked">forts,<a name="FNanchor_219" id="FNanchor_219" href="#Footnote_219" class="fnanchor">219</a></span>
continued our journey through a district thickly interspersed with villages
and hamlets, but destitute of pasture land, though otherwise
richly cultivated, the rice fields profusely irrigated. Whampoa was
mean-looking, the greater number of its houses erected on piles so as
to overhang the river; the stream crowded with ships and vessels of
sorts belonging to various nations. The foreign population lived in
“chops” or hulks of Chinese junks; others were utilised as offices and
merchants’ stores. Docks were being established, and other improvements
effected which, in later years, have made that place the actual
port of the southern capital.</p>

<p>Arrived at Canton, landing was effected by means of one of the
thousands of sampans or passenger boats that lay along either bank
and crowded the river,&mdash;&#8203;these boats “manned” by women, who kept up
a chorus of laughing and talking, their cheery and, for the most part,
well-looking faces indicating that cares, as understood in the West,
pressed upon them but lightly, if at all. “Sing-song,” or <span class="locked">Flower-boats,<a name="FNanchor_220" id="FNanchor_220" href="#Footnote_220" class="fnanchor">220</a></span>
gorgeously painted and otherwise ornamented, lay in tiers, and towered
high above the humble sampan. The particular race of natives by
whom, through many generations, they have been occupied, are looked
upon as descendants of the <i>kin</i> who held Northern China, <span class="smcap smaller">A.D.</span> 1100,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_169" id="Page_169">169</a></span>
supplemented by those of traitors who aided the Japanese in their
descent upon Cheh-kiang, <span class="smcap smaller">A.D.</span> 1555&ndash;1563. Having landed, the “carriage”
by which our further trip was taken consisted of “chairs” made
of bamboo work, carried on the shoulders of three brawny Chinamen,
namely, two in front and one behind, their strong muscles thrown in
bold relief on their uncovered chests and limbs as they carried us at
rapid pace along. Such were the conditions in 1860.</p>

<p>The island of Honan was occupied by various important <i>hongs</i>,
or places of business belonging to native Chinese merchants. One of
them, the property of Houqua, whose name at that time was familiar in
England, was devoted to the cleaning and preparation of teas for the
market. The large and well-aired hall within was occupied by a series
of tables placed at convenient distances from each other. At each sat
a man or woman&mdash;&#8203;for the sexes worked together&mdash;&#8203;who from a basket
at hand picked the coarser fragments, and so left the finer description
of the tea to be dealt with again. In another hall stood a couple of
<span class="locked">fanners;<a name="FNanchor_221" id="FNanchor_221" href="#Footnote_221" class="fnanchor">221</a></span> through them the tea was passed, the finer portions being
separated in the process from the coarser. This apartment was ornamented
with flowers and shrubs in pots; a delicious flavour of “the
fragrant leaf” pervaded the air. All around was scrupulously clean
and tidy, the <i>employés</i> neat in person, well-clothed, apparently well fed,
and, to judge by their smiles and good humour, very happy.</p>

<p>Everywhere in the streets blind beggars abounded, each armed with
two flat discs of bamboo; the sound produced by constantly beating
them against each other became decidedly unpleasant by their very
numbers, rendering conversation impossible. Whether a great part
of their blindness was due to disease or to artificial means, we had no
means of ascertaining.</p>

<p>The Tartar suburb or quarter of Canton comprised narrow streets
paved with flag stones, intersected by narrow canals, spanned at intervals
by bridges after the style of the “willow pattern plate”; the houses
of no more than one storey high, for the reason that in China it is considered
pretentious for a man to raise himself above his fellows. The
odours that everywhere prevailed exceeded, in variety and intensity, all
that had heretofore been experienced. The people, old and young,
male and female, poor in circumstances as many of them appeared
to be, looked physically hale, strong, and healthy. Traversing the
breadth of the city, we arrived at “The Heights,” on the slope of which
stood the Yamen of the notorious Yeh; near thereto, “The Five-Storied
Pagoda,” now occupied by French troops, and above it waved the
Tricolour; while in a series of bell tents were the men of the 87th<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_170" id="Page_170">170</a></span>
Royal Irish Fusiliers&mdash;&#8203;the conjunction not altogether a happy one,
seeing that the 87th wear on their shakos a French eagle, in commemoration
of that captured by them at Barossa. Various temples and other
public buildings were visited in the course of our interesting excursion;
one of the latter a native prison, ricketty, tottering, and foul, its unhappy
inmates lying upon the damp floor, chained, or with <i>cangs</i> on their
necks, their existence dependent upon food supplied from without,
their naked bodies besmeared with filth and presenting many ulcers.
Many of them were not accused of crimes committed by themselves,
but were undergoing punishment for the reason that their relatives had
joined the ranks of the Taiping rebels. We intentionally refrained
from a visit to “the Potter’s field,” or execution ground, immediately
adjacent to the prison.</p>

<p>Everywhere along the streets were signs of activity and industry;
shops containing all sorts of clothing materials, strangely ornamented
umbrellas and lanterns; others devoted to old curiosities, jewelry, or
watch-making, a good many to lacquer ware; nor could we withhold
admiration of the elegant patterns and workmanship of such articles
as cabinets, tables, screens, fans, etc., exposed for sale. But here, as in
countries more advanced in certain phases of civilization, signs of
superstition are apparent. Above the door of such establishments
a horse’s hoof is nailed, and so Satanic influences guarded against.
In the enlightened West, a horse’s shoe fulfils the same purpose.</p>

<p>The Temple of the Five Hundred Gods or worthies, then deemed
one of the most characteristic sights of Canton, well repaid our
visit to it. Among objects within that edifice is a miniature pagoda
of eight stages, the whole consisting of beautifully cut marble, its
total height twenty-five feet. The figures of the gods or heroes are
all life-size. They represent various nationalities, one of their number
in feature and dress like an Englishman. According to legend, the
person so commemorated was a sailor, cast ashore wrecked on the
coast of China. His life being spared, he ultimately rose to high position,
and finally was, in effigy, honoured with a place in this Walhalla.</p>

<p>Another portion of the building was devoted to the purposes of a
Buddhist temple, in which, at the time of our visit, “service” was
being performed, or “celebrated.” The scene within comprised an
altar, plain, without idols or other decoration; situated in an open
space, bare-headed and shaven priests, some wearing robes of blue,
others of grey cloth, all with a yellow-coloured surplice thrown over the
left shoulder and brought loosely under the right arm. As they knelt
at various distances from the altar, in seeming accordance with their
rank, their hands in attitude of supplication, they joined in chanting<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_171" id="Page_171">171</a></span>
what, in its intonation, resembled the Litany of our Western Churches;
at intervals a small bell being gently struck, as in the Roman Catholic
service. A congregation of men was present, but manifestly destitute of
reverence or devotion. A few days were thus pleasantly spent; I
then returned to duty at Hong-Kong. At the time referred to, that
island was noted for the hospitality of residents, and the scale of
magnificence upon which it was carried on. It was my good fortune to
enjoy much of it, and of friendliness in other ways; among others,
from representatives of the great houses of Jardine, Dent, and others,
and from Mr. Campbell, then of the Oriental Bank.</p>

<p>Towards the end of August, a French Express boat brought intelligence
that the English and French combined forces had landed at
Pehtang; that, while advancing thence to Taku, our cavalry had been
charged by the Tartar horse, with results disastrous to the latter. A
few days more, news reached us that a somewhat sharp action had
taken place, with somewhat severe loss to the allies, but leaving in
their hands Taku and neighbouring forts; that the whole disposable
force was in rapid motion towards Tientsin, in view to carrying out the
intention of Lord Elgin to push on to the capital. A short interval
passed, when attempts at negotiation at Tientsin having failed, the army
continued its onward march. At Tungchow, a very sad occurrence
befell it. By treachery, a body of Chinese, headed by the Prince Tsai,
captured several officials, officers, and others; namely, Mr. Parkes, Mr.
Bowlby (of the <i>Times</i>), Mr. Loch, Mr. De Normann, Lieutenant Anderson,
Captain Brabazon, and several troopers belonging to Fane’s Horse.
The Chinese army, under San ko Lin Sin, was, however, completely
beaten; the road to Pekin left clear. Lord Elgin at once sent a communication
to the Emperor, that, in the event of a hair of the head
of one of the prisoners being touched, the combined forces would burn
the Imperial palace to the ground.</p>

<p>A few days more, and on October 13 the allied army was in
possession of the Chinese quarter of Pekin; the palace outside and
north of the city given up to loot; the Emperor fled; the Summer
Palace in ruins; the Chinese army vanished! Unhappily, news at the
same time reached us that, although Mr. Parkes and Mr. Loch had
been given up by the Chinese, they had been subject to various indignities
before being so; but that others of the prisoners had succumbed
under the barbarities to which they were subjected, among them Mr.
Bowlby.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_172" id="Page_172">172</a></span><a name="FNanchor_222" id="FNanchor_222" href="#Footnote_222" class="fnanchor">222</a></p>

<p>Early in November, information reached us that a treaty of peace
had been signed in the Imperial capital by Prince Kung and Lord
Elgin. In accordance with its conditions, in addition to a war
indemnity to be paid by the Chinese, a special sum was to be given for
the families of the captives who had been killed or died in captivity.
Thus, the object of the expedition had been obtained more speedily
than Lord Elgin expected. The forces began their return march from
Pekin towards Taku, there to embark, a brigade being detailed to
occupy Tientsin until the indemnity should be paid.</p>

<p>In obedience to orders to join “the Army of <span class="locked">Occupation”<a name="FNanchor_223" id="FNanchor_223" href="#Footnote_223" class="fnanchor">223</a></span> at Tientsin,
as the brigade left at that place was now officially called, I left Hong-Kong
by the steamer <i>Formosa</i>, on November 28. Next day, we
passed the mouth of the river Han, on the western bank of which
stands Shah-tew, or, as pronounced in English, Swatow; the day
following, traversed the channel that separates the island of Formosa
from the city of Amoy on the mainland. Already the temperature
was pleasantly cool, sky clear, wind and sea rather high, the effect
of these conditions bracing and exhilarating, as compared with that
produced by the trying and unpleasant climate we had left behind
us. The general aspect of the coast wherever visible, as we advanced
on our voyage, was bare and inhospitable. In our course, islands were
numerous, the majority apparently uninhabited even by birds, and
otherwise uninviting to look upon. As we approached the Yangtse,
vegetation covered more and more thickly the islands passed by us;
sea-birds were increasingly numerous, the water thick with mud. We
arrived at Shanghai on December 3.</p>

<p>In the latter days of August, Shanghai had been seriously attacked
by the Taiping rebels. On both occasions, the Imperialists fled before
the enemy; but a foreign contingent of British, Indian, and French
troops, with a body of volunteers composed of the foreign residents,
repulsed the rebels, on whom they inflicted severe loss. During the
attacks in question, several buildings had been destroyed or seriously
damaged, the ruins being prominent objects in our view. So
also were the remains of barricades and other extemporised defences.
On the day of our arrival, the Indian Navy vessel, the <i>Feroze</i>, having on
board Lord Elgin and suite, steamed up the Woosung River and
anchored alongside us. The following day the <i>Grenada</i> arrived, with
Sir Hope Grant, his staff, and various senior officers of the expedition,
whose allotted task was completed in that the object of the expedition
had been attained. But a new phase was about to be assumed by public<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_173" id="Page_173">173</a></span>
affairs; arrangements had to be made for events, the shadow, as
well as substance, of which affected the immediate vicinity of Shanghai,
and extended over a great part of China. Whereas, diplomatic
and military action had been directed heretofore against the Imperial
power, both were now to be devoted to the support of that power,
and against insurrectionary <span class="locked">movements,<a name="FNanchor_224" id="FNanchor_224" href="#Footnote_224" class="fnanchor">224</a></span> the real object of which was
the overthrow of the ruling dynasty. Various bands of marauders,
taking advantage of existing disturbances, were devastating the neighbourhood.
Piratical bands, in which were enrolled escaped sailors and
vagabonds of sorts, were giving so much trouble on the Yangtse,
that it was necessary at once to dispatch a small river force for their
suppression.</p>

<p>Copies of the <span class="locked">Treaty<a name="FNanchor_225" id="FNanchor_225" href="#Footnote_225" class="fnanchor">225</a></span> signed at Pekin on October 24 were
immediately affixed to the walls throughout the native city of Shanghai.
Crowds of Chinese assembled at various places to read the unwonted
documents, printed as they were in their own language. An English
version was at the same time published, for the benefit of foreigners,
the nine articles comprised in it being to the effect that&mdash;&#8203;(1) The
Emperor expresses his deep regret for the affair at Taku; (2) Her
Majesty’s representative shall reside permanently, or occasionally, as she
may wish, at Pekin; (3) Eight millions of taels (£2,000,000) to be
paid in instalments (as indemnity); (4) Tientsin to be opened for trade;
(5) Emigration of Chinese to British colonies to be permitted; (6)
Kowloon to be ceded; (7) The Treaty of 1858 shall come at once into
operation; (8) That Treaty shall be published in Pekin and in the
provinces; (9) On the Convention being signed, Chusan to be restored
to Chinese (from occupation by the British), the British forces to commence
their march from Pekin to Tientsin; that, if necessary, Taku,
the north coast of Shantung, and Canton shall be occupied until the
indemnity is paid. The morning after that Proclamation had been
affixed to the walls, it was found in tatters and defaced!</p>

<p>A visit to the native city and its immediate surroundings introduced
us to scenes characteristic of Chinese habits and of the particular circumstances
of the time. Within the city and fosse a succession of
narrow dirty streets, low-built houses, canals spanned by “willow
pattern” bridges, cook shops, vegetable stalls, fur and “curio” shops.
Adjoining one such street, a wretched shed, the damp earthen floor
partly covered with straw, partly with refuse of very filthy kind. On<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_174" id="Page_174">174</a></span>
the floor three human dead bodies, emaciated from starvation; a
woman almost devoid of clothing, wasted to an extreme degree, wailing
piteously over one of the three; another, still alive, but to all appearance
in the last extreme from long-continued want of food. This we
were informed is <i>the</i> place to which the miserably poor, and those who
give up the battle of life, resort to die. Among the establishments
visited were numerous fur shops, an extensive store of china or porcelain
ware, a factory in which is woven the beautiful gold embroidery
for which Shanghai is famous,&mdash;&#8203;the embroidery being for the most part
on blue cloth, its own most characteristic pattern the Imperial dragon,
distinguished by having five toes, whereas the more plebeian emblems
of the same survival of the pterodactyl has but four. What had been
until recently ornamental “Tea” gardens were now occupied by French
troops; once highly ornamented buildings within such enclosures converted
into barracks for our allies. Uprooted shrubs and valuable
plants lay about decayed and withered; rockwork, including fanciful-shaped
miniature bridges, cast like so much rubbish into what had been
artificial lakes and streams peopled by fish and water-plants. The glory
of the place was indeed gone&mdash;&#8203;desecrated, as the Chinese could not
inappropriately say, by Western “barbarians.”</p>

<p>To a distance of several miles inland from the city the aspect of the
country is more or less that of a continuous burial ground, interspersed
with coffins left as they were placed, upon rather than under the surface
of the ground, many of them broken and so exposing to view their
ghastly contents. Here and there patches of ground were devoted to
the cultivation of vegetables, in the midst of graves and coffins; while
continuing our walk we met isolated coolies carrying at each end
of an elastic piece of bamboo, supported on the shoulder at its middle,
a jar containing the bones of their “ancestors,” being so borne
away, doubtless, to be reverently disposed of elsewhere. Everywhere
the district was intersected by canals and water-courses, raised
and narrow pathways across the intervening fields; we seemed to be
wandering in the “city of the silent.” Alongside the several canals and
pathways were avenues of trees and ornamental <span class="locked">shrubs.<a name="FNanchor_226" id="FNanchor_226" href="#Footnote_226" class="fnanchor">226</a></span> The presence
of the magpie, jackdaw, wagtail, and sandpiper carried our associations
away to the “insignificant island in the Western sea.” Game birds
were abundant, as we had an opportunity of witnessing in the city
market; but since that date we learn that villas, gardens, and ornamental
grounds have grown up, and so completely transformed the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_175" id="Page_175">175</a></span>
landscape as seen by us. Almost at every turn we met French soldiers
off duty, or in considerable bodies marching from Woosung, at which
place reinforcements were being landed from transports; in fact, there
was little in the aspect of Shanghai to indicate that it was an English
settlement. These and some other excursions were taken in company
of Mr. Lamond, to whom I was much indebted for hospitality.</p>

<p>H.M.S. <i>Roebuck</i>, by which I was ordered to proceed northward, left
Shanghai on December 11. Three days afterwards we were off the
promontory of Shantung; the weather propitious, sky clear, breeze
moderate, temperature on deck 48° F. to 44° F., sea smooth. But a
rapid change took place. During the night of the 14th, darkness became
so intense that Captain Martin, deeming it unsafe to proceed in
a region little known and imperfectly surveyed, determined to cast
anchor. By midnight we were in a heavy wind storm; it having
cleared off by daylight, the ship resumed progress and was speedily
among the Meatao Islands; a few hours more and we were in Hope
Sound, otherwise a sheltered position in the concavity of the larger
island of that group, called Chang Shang, where we found the British
fleet collected, that of the French being off Chefoo, not far from our
own. The <i>Roebuck</i> was ordered to await dispatches. While so doing,
a number of rough-looking natives, brown in hue, Tartar in feature,
their clothing partly consisting of wadded cotton, but in addition
abundance of furs, came alongside in their boats, bringing with them
rolls of bread, vegetables and fruits, similar to those we are accustomed
to see at home. The presence of numbers of the common gull,
the colder weather, the rougher sea, combined still further to recall the
shores of England.</p>

<p>Arrived off <span class="locked">Taku,<a name="FNanchor_227" id="FNanchor_227" href="#Footnote_227" class="fnanchor">227</a></span> so thick was the haze and mist by which that
place and the sea to some distance from it were concealed, that for
several hours neither the forts nor coast were visible, nor was it till the
following day that we were able to land. The little gunboat the <i>Clown</i>
having taken us on board, we were quickly in sight of the forts, some of
them very formidable in appearance; in the shallow discoloured water
stakes still stood in lines where they had opposed the approach of
Admiral Hope’s gunboats, and we were able to estimate the further difficulties
on that occasion presented by the long stretch of mud which at
low tide separated us from the forts. As evening was closing in, we
entered the mouth of the Peiho; in due time were within the southern
fort, above which floated the Union Jack, the northern being similarly
distinguished by the Tricolour. The great extent of its mud ramparts<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_176" id="Page_176">176</a></span>
was seen as we passed the inner gateway; huts in rows that had been
occupied by its defenders were now used as barracks by officers and
men of the detachment temporarily stationed here, or by military stores.
In all directions old gun carriages, broken wheels, furniture, and <i>débris</i>
of sorts lay about in a state of confusion. I was under the very unpleasant
necessity of <i>begging</i> a night’s accommodation from an officer, a
charity which he kindly accorded me.</p>

<p>Mounted on a borrowed horse, without guard or guide, I started next
day <i>en route</i> to my destination, the distance to be travelled not less than
thirty miles. A midday halt to rest my steed; a solitary ride along
an ill-made road, through a flat, uninteresting tract of country, and final
arrival without misadventure at Tientsin, completed the day’s proceedings.
Already the cold had become severe; the wind, strong from east,
swept over the plain; patches of water and canals were covered by ice;
thus the journey has left on memory not a very agreeable impression.
On arrival, however, I was kindly received by a brother officer.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_177" id="Page_177">177</a></span><a name="FNanchor_228" id="FNanchor_228" href="#Footnote_228" class="fnanchor">228</a></p>

<p class="drop-cap5"><span class="smcap1">Arrangements</span> rapidly advanced in regard to accommodation,
food supplies, and medical care of the troops. <i>Yamens</i>&mdash;&#8203;<i>i.e.</i>,
residences of wealthy inhabitants&mdash;&#8203;were hired for temporary conversion
into barracks. Markets and shops presented ample supplies of food,
clothing, and articles of convenience, their owners showing much
eagerness to do business with us. A tendency to pilfer, and other
petty crimes, manifested itself on the part of some Asiatic followers and
others, but was quickly suppressed by the Provost Marshal and his
staff, after which discipline and order reigned among all classes pertaining
to our force. Our French allies occupied quarters provided for
them in the part of the city on the left side of the Peiho, the British
and Indian being on the right of that river.</p>

<p>The city was of great commercial importance, its population some
800,000; streets narrow and filthy, houses low and dilapidated; in
extent stretching away to and embracing the point of junction between
the Imperial Canal and Peiho, thus covering a space of at least four
miles by three. Merchandise from Corea and the south of China
arrived abundantly as at a general depôt. Around the city proper a
high wall extends, the crowded portion outside being called “suburbs,”
but in no other respect different from the intra-mural city. In the
Peiho was a Russian gunboat; in the city a small colony of Russian
merchants, peacefully carrying on their business, and apparently on the
most friendly terms with the people. A few Tartar traders, some leading
their strong shaggy ponies, others Bactrian camels, all laden with<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_178" id="Page_178">178</a></span>
merchandise, were met with. As we pursued our way through the
mazes of the city, the people simply ignored our presence, taking not
the slightest notice of us, although by the caricatures of Europeans we
frequently came across in shops and elsewhere it was evident that
we were by no means welcome guests. In an open space a modeller
was occupied in making, with great ease and rapidity, a series of
figures in clay, representing, though with droll exaggeration, the Sikh
and British soldiers. Women were conspicuous by their absence;
virtue in the sex was honoured and commemorated by memorial
arches at certain points throughout the city. Everywhere in the
crowded, narrow, and extremely dirty streets, foot-passengers jostled
each other; the diseased, of whom many suffering from loathsome
affections, coming in contact with those better-to-do, and to all appearance
healthy. At intervals a puppet show, the prototype of Punch
and Judy, or more pretentious “show” attracted crowds; itinerant
“doctors,” their carts decorated with exaggerated illustrations of
diseases and accidents, remedies for which were vociferously lauded
and offered for sale. On either side pawnshops and restaurants; at the
doors of the latter customers gambling whether they should pay double
or quits for refreshments or foods served to them.</p>

<p>In vain we looked for representatives of Tartar troops, who were
said to form the ordinary garrison force of Tientsin. We learned that,
for the period of occupation by the foreigners, steps had been taken
“to keep them out of sight.”</p>

<p>A series of rides into the country in the vicinity of the city presented
a great variety of interesting objects and incidents. On the left bank
of the Peiho, a short distance down the course of that river, numerous
large stacks of table salt attracted attention, as similar stacks on the
same spot did that of Lord Macartney’s mission nearly seventy years
before. The arrival of the first trading ship under the recent treaty
was an event not without interest; it was a small schooner, the property
of a very eminent <span class="locked">firm<a name="FNanchor_229" id="FNanchor_229" href="#Footnote_229" class="fnanchor">229</a></span> at Hong-Kong, and as it immediately
became ice-bound, it was to be a familiar object to us throughout the
succeeding winter. Although so recently at war with the Chinese, we
from the first walked or rode into the country without molestation, receiving
invitations by signs to enter houses and huts that lay in our
way; tea and cakes of various kinds being invariably pressed upon us
on such occasions. In certain directions it seemed as if there was one
continuous burial ground; coffins in all stages of decay strewed the surface;
at intervals bodies of children sewn up in mats were seen, while<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_179" id="Page_179">179</a></span>
on one occasion we saw the revolting spectacle of a dog in the act of
carrying away the dead body of an infant.</p>

<p>In every village there were great numbers of dogs, fierce towards us
foreigners; some by no means unlike “collies,” others terriers, of
which a very handsome variety obtains its special title from Shantung,
to which district it more especially pertains. There were also the
mandarin or “sleeve dogs,” so named from the fact that as pets the
smaller varieties are carried in the wide sleeves of the outer garments
worn by the wealthy classes. There was the Canton or “chow-chow”
dog, a large animal with a very thick coating of hair, the tail curling
from its root; the head triangular, broad at the base, rapidly tapering
to the muzzle; the eyes far forward, as if looking upward, something
like those of the lemur. Pet birds were kept by many people, songsters
being the greatest favourites. Of those observed were a large species
of skylark, canaries, thrushes, linnets, a species here called the wamee,
like the <span class="locked">Shamah<a name="FNanchor_230" id="FNanchor_230" href="#Footnote_230" class="fnanchor">230</a></span> of India.</p>

<p>It became an object of interest to note the progress of agriculture,
and the phenomena of nature generally, from the first opening of mild
weather, onwards till autumn. On the 1st of March wheat sowing
began, the fields having been prepared during the previous few days
for that operation; five days thereafter&mdash;&#8203;namely, on the 6th&mdash;&#8203;the first
indication was evident that buds were about to open, a species of
poplar being the tree to take the lead in this respect. The operation
of ploughing the fields then began; the implement used was of light
construction, drawn by one man, while another guided it. Fields then
began to be cleaned, manure to be spread, seed of various kinds for
grain and vegetables sown, preparations for irrigation carried out; and
as the surface ground thawed, and so became the more easily dealt
with, ploughs of heavier kinds were used, mules, bullocks, and men
promiscuously used and yoked together in draught. In other places
women and girls were employed in field work. By the 15th signs of
verdure began to show themselves near the irrigation canals, partly in
the first leaf of autumn-sown wheat, partly of some culinary vegetable.
On the 20th, wheat sown on the 1st had “shot,” and was in tolerable
leaf; after this its progress was rapid, for by the 9th of June the fact
was noted that “some fields of wheat were turning yellow the crop
nearly ready to be cut”; pease, full in the pod.</p>

<p>At the distance of about four miles from Tientsin, on the left bank of
the Peiho, we came upon a series of buildings, the purpose of which
the storage of grain against famine. Sixteen such buildings, arranged<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_180" id="Page_180">180</a></span>
in two rows of eight, constitute the group devoted to that purpose;
each building some 300 feet in length, 45 to 50 in breadth, its walls 30
in height, the whole raised on a plinth from the ground. By Imperial
edict cultivators are obliged to deposit in these and kindred stores
elsewhere a certain proportion of grain every year: an arrangement
which has come down from ancient times, and on that account is
now mentioned.</p>

<p>Very rapid was the increase of winter cold to its point of culmination.
Situated in the latitude of Lisbon, the temperature of 5·5° F.
during the night preceding the shortest day was to us a new and unlooked-for
experience, yet next day active outdoor exercise was indulged
in; the sensations soon ceased to indicate the actual degree of
cold prevailing. Already the Peiho was closed in by ice, boats had
given place to sledges, and they, pushed on by means of poles, were
used in great numbers for transport of merchandise. A detachment of
troops had just arrived by <i>White Star</i> at Taku. The officer in command
landed with his men, his intention being to make arrangements
for their march from that place, and then return to the ship for his wife.
But meanwhile ice had formed so rapidly on the shallow bay that communication
between the vessel and shore was impossible, the result
that the <i>White Star</i> had to return to Hong-Kong, nor did the <span class="locked">officer<a name="FNanchor_231" id="FNanchor_231" href="#Footnote_231" class="fnanchor">231</a></span>
alluded to see his wife or kit until next spring had well advanced. According
to the Royal Chinese Almanack, published at Pekin, the winter
season is divided into nine periods of nine days each. The first begins
on December 20, the third on January 8, it ends on 17th of that
month, and is considered to be that of the greatest cold; the last of the
series is considered to end on March 2.</p>

<p>Communication with ships in the northern part of the Gulf of
Pe chili being cut off, letters had to be dispatched by land to Chefoo,
two hundred miles to the southward, there to be put on board. Now
a cold north wind set in; the temperature in our rooms sank at night
to 3° F. As we awoke in the morning small icicles clung to moustaches,
and during the day the sensation of cold became unpleasant.
In the provision shops, fish and game frozen; some of the latter, especially
deer, in artistic or picturesque attitudes, were exposed for sale.
Men were engaged in cutting blocks of ice from that which covered the
river, to be kept in pits and ice-houses for use during the heat of next
summer. Through the openings so made small nets were let down for
the capture of fish that happened to resort to those air-holes. Within
our quarters water for cooking purposes and for the morning bath had
to be obtained by breaking blocks of ice and placing the fragments to<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_181" id="Page_181">181</a></span>
be liquefied in a vessel on the fire. Out of doors the unusual sight might
be witnessed of soldiers carrying in sacks on their backs the blocks of
ice into which the daily allowance of beer or porter had been congealed.
As winter advanced sensation of cold naturally enough increased;
northerly winds came over the long tract of flat country, several degrees
in extent, that lay between us and Mongolia. Now it was that in our
quarters we utilised the Chinese heated platform as a bed, to which is
given the name of <i>kang</i>, not only for sleeping thereon, but for sitting or
reclining during the day. Fireplaces according to advanced Western
principles had been constructed, under the superintendence of the
Royal Engineers; in them was burnt a liberal allowance of fuel, consisting
of Manchurian coal and Pe chili mud in about equal proportions;
but, as expressed by our Chinese servants, the arrangement was
more calculated to carry the warmth clean away up the chimney than
to diffuse it in our apartments.</p>

<p>On February 19 there were signs that the intensity of winter was
about to cease; the mid-day sunshine had in it some genial warmth;
intensely cold winds that had for some time prevailed now did so no
longer; the haze in which city and district had been concealed was to
some extent gone, and yet the reading of the thermometer was a
minimum at night of 8° F., at nine a.m. 19·8° F. Snow that had shortly
before fallen began to melt as day advanced, and the thick coating of
ice on the Peiho became wet and sloppy. The few succeeding days,
increasingly mild and genial, well illustrated the regularity and rapidity
with which seasonal changes here take place. On March 3 winter
was considered to be ended, spring to have began according to the
Chinese estimate already mentioned, though at night the thermometer
indicated 30° F., and at nine a.m. 33° F., snow meanwhile falling
gently.</p>

<p>On 5th of that month a state of great electric tension in air was indicated
by our registers. As in India, that condition heralded change
in weather, its seasonal recurrence so regular that it is reckoned on to a
day. The crews of a Russian gunboat and of an English schooner,
frozen up through the winter, at once began the work of preparation
for sea. On the 11th the ice suddenly broke up; in massive blocks
grating against and rolling over each other, it floated along the stream.
Next day, bridges of boats were re-established, ordinary traffic by boat resumed;
within a few hours all traces of ice had disappeared. On the 14th
the gunboat <i>Drake</i> arrived from Taku, bringing for us thirteen weeks’
letters from home, none having been received while cut off from the
world as we had been for so long. Orders were at the same time received
directing Mr. Bruce to proceed to Pekin, and our force to remain<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_182" id="Page_182">182</a></span>
at Tientsin, pending the manner of reception given to His Excellency
at the Imperial capital. By April 6 the temperature rendered the exercise
of walking unpleasant. By the middle of June, in the absence of
tatties and other Indian appliances, resource was had to large blocks
of ice supported over a tub in our apartments; close to and half embracing
these we sat, in the airiest of costume, in our endeavours to keep
ourselves cool under the circumstances.</p>

<p>Everywhere in and around the city, steps were taken to maintain due
observance of respect towards buildings dedicated to purposes of
“religion” or philosophy. In the early days of occupation, some of the
Asiatics with us treated a few of those buildings in a manner that they
would have violently resented if directed against their own in India;
but the employment of stringent measures put an end to such demonstrations.
In one of those temples, namely that dedicated to “Oceanic
Influences,” at a short distance beyond the city walls, the Treaty of
Tientsin of 1859 was signed, the ratification of that deed being the
actual cause of the present war.</p>

<p>Invited to a Chinese hunting and hawking party, the “meet” to take
place at a distance of a few miles from the city, we proceeded to the
appointed rendezvous under guidance of men sent for the purpose by our
hosts. In early morning of a bitterly cold day in January we started,
our steeds, shaggy, unkempt-looking Tartar ponies. Arrived at the appointed
ground, several falconers, all on foot, each bearing on his wrist a
peregrine, hooded, awaited us; the hounds of the kind known in India as
the rampore, all under charge of a mounted whipper-in. All around us
a dead flat plain extended, to all appearance interminably, all crops removed,
the surface frozen hard, but without snow. Soon the pack was
scouring the plain in full chase of an unfortunate hare, the hounds being
slipped as the quarry started; the falcons, unhooded, take wing. Away
went our ponies at full speed, their pace a run, not a gallop. First one
falcon and then another swooped down upon and rolled over the hunted
animal; the dogs fast gain upon her; she disappears, for in this forestless
region holes in the earth and burrows are so taken advantage of by
ground game. A huntsman bares his arm; he reaches into one such opening;
the hare is drawn out, crying in its terror like a child; it is dispatched
by a blow on the nape. This we are told is “sport.” To some of
us it would be more appropriately called barbarous and unmanly cruelty.
Further details of what proved to be “a successful day” need not be
related.</p>

<p>New Year’s <span class="locked">Eve,<a name="FNanchor_232" id="FNanchor_232" href="#Footnote_232" class="fnanchor">232</a></span> according to the Chinese Calendar, was celebrated<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_183" id="Page_183">183</a></span>
by the discharge of thousands of crackers and other fireworks, that being
their manner of announcing to the world that the ceremony of propitiating
their household gods had begun; the object in view, absolution for
equivocal acts committed during the past twelve months. For several
previous days the city was <i xml:lang="fr" lang="fr">en fête</i>; establishments closed; caricatures distributed
as so many valentines; visits of friendship and of ceremony
exchanged; family and other misunderstandings arranged; much feasting
and carousing indulged in; houses swept and garnished in token that all
things unpleasant, whether physical or ethical, had been cast out. The
fronts of houses were decorated with strips of vermilion-coloured paper
containing expressions of good-will and congratulation; ornamental
lanterns were everywhere on sale, for purposes of illuminations, their
shapes various and often grotesque, as fishes, frogs, dragons, and monsters
of various forms. Buddhist temples had on their altars a series of
gigantic candles, all “dyed red,” bearing designs of dragons and other
mythical creatures, before which people knelt with every appearance of
devotion.</p>

<p>It became a source of interest to a few of us to visit places and institutions
of purely Chinese origin or character. Of such places, a public
bathing establishment was one, the interior well lighted, spacious, pervaded
by steam from water heated by a furnace, the fuel of which
consisted of reeds and straw. A series of troughs, and at one end a
plunge bath, were being used by considerable numbers of men at a time,
the charge for each being about a farthing. Here then were public
baths existing as a Chinese institution, though even yet their introduction
generally into England remains rather in the initiative than accomplished
stage.</p>

<p>Very different in kind was an ice pit, otherwise a large underground
room, one part of which was devoted to the preservation of that substance,
another having a series of shelves crowded with vegetables and
fruit of different kinds. As we descend into that pit, the sensation we
experienced was that of comparative <i>warmth</i>, so bitterly cold had the
wind outside become.</p>

<p>The Chinese Foundling Hospital, situated in the suburbs of the city,
was a large and substantial building; its chief ornament a tablet, the
characters on which intimated that the door over which it was placed
was the entrance to “The Hall for Cherishing Children.” At the time
of our visit the institution contained eighty foundlings; to each of those
still in infancy was assigned a wet nurse. One portion of the establishment
was occupied by children, and some grown-up persons affected
with various infirmities, as the blind, the deaf, and the idiotic, together
with their respective attendants. Being invited by the superintendent<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_184" id="Page_184">184</a></span>
to visit his own quarters, a tablet over the entrance door thereto displayed
the characters, “We beseech thee to rescue the naked”; on the walls of
the reception hall a series of tablets with names of patrons and donors
of considerable sums; others with items of regulations relating to the
administration of the institution. The children, if in good health, are
disposed of at fourteen years of age&mdash;&#8203;some adopted, some become servants,
others apprenticed to trades. To the girls who marry, a dowry
of the equivalent value of £5 is given.</p>

<p>At the end of March a visit by the Roman Catholic bishop of Pekin
gave us the opportunity of hearing from himself his strange story. In
1834 the cathedral erected in Pekin by the Jesuits in the seventeenth
century was closed during an outbreak of the populace against that
mission, several of its members put to death, others “disappearing,” to
be no more heard of. Among the latter was for many years the bishop.
Taken from the power of the rioters by some of the Catholic converts,
he was concealed by them in the capital, and protected for the long
period of twenty-seven years, he meanwhile carrying on his special work
among them. The arrival at Pekin of the allied army was quickly followed
by the re-opening of the cathedral and celebration of Grand Mass therein.
On that occasion, as the procession of priests attached to the forces, and
their acolytes, advanced toward the altar, the bishop, wearing ordinary
Chinese costume, emerged from the throng, and took his place at its
head. The Emperor of the French being made acquainted with the
story, desired to see the bishop at the Tuileries to hear it from himself.
While on his way through Tientsin the bishop remained with us several
days. To inquiries on the subject, he remarked that his <i>first</i> endeavour
with the Chinese was to teach them the practical results of Christianity,
rather than inculcate doctrines, the significance of which were beyond
their train of thought.</p>

<p>As early as practicable, measures were taken to establish a charitable
hospital for the sick poor of Tientsin. For that purpose £100 was
given by Admiral Sir James Hope, and subscriptions established among
the officers of the force; applications to the rich natives being unproductive.
At last, a building capable of accommodating twenty patients
was engaged and fitted up for its purpose; professional work being
undertaken by Dr. Lamprey, 67th Regiment. Under him its reputation
rapidly spread, so much so that applications for admission exceeded our
means of reception. In those days the use of chloroform was still in its
infancy; very wonderful in the idea of the patients did its effect appear,
exceeding, as they expressed themselves, “the power of the Dragon.”
The majority, however, looked upon the drug with suspicion, preferring
to undergo operations&mdash;&#8203;even of great severity&mdash;&#8203;without it or any other<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_185" id="Page_185">185</a></span>
anæsthetic. Their apparent indifference to pain under such circumstance
was to us subject of amazement.</p>

<p>Duties connected with this hospital gave me an opportunity of seeing
the contracted foot, otherwise “golden lily,” of a Chinese woman.
The foot had been deformed by the method of cramping usually
followed for that purpose; the four smaller toes pressed under the sole,
the natural arch raised to an altogether abnormal degree, the points of
support limited to the heel and tip of the great-toe. The process of
contraction takes place in early youth; it is conducted by means of
bandages “artistically” applied, and is said to be painless. The aspect
of the foot is thus made hideous, while the natural contour of the calf
being destroyed, the appearance of the limb below the knee is&mdash;&#8203;to
Western eyes&mdash;&#8203;ungraceful.</p>

<p>Neither by word or manner was the slightest gratitude expressed
for benefits thus conferred upon them. But in one respect their demeanour
drew from us a measure of appreciation; namely, in the care
and assistance shown to each other by male patients. Contrasted therewith,
however, their want of thoughtful care for sick women was no
less remarkable; the more suitable of the two wards having been given
up to the latter, the arrangement was protested against in no “gallant”
terms by the men.</p>

<p>For a short time an idea seemed to prevail that an object with which
the hospital was set on foot was, that in it attempts would be made
upon sick inmates to press upon them what they called “the Western
philosophy.” Their minds were set at rest on this point; but among
the patients there was a Christian convert, around whom other inmates
in increasing numbers came to listen, while he read and expounded
from a Chinese version of the Scriptures of which he was the
possessor.</p>

<p>In our regular military hospital were several Tartar soldiers, some of
them severely wounded, who had been picked up on the field of battle
by our establishments, and now treated like our own men. In due time
they recovered from their injuries as far as art could effect their restoration;
they came to appreciate the <i>comforts</i> of their position so much
that among their numbers no anxiety was expressed to be discharged.
Application was made to the Chinese local authorities to receive them.
The reply by them was to the effect that “the men having fallen in
battle, they were officially dead; there being no precedent of dead men
coming to life again, they could in no way recognise or acknowledge
them.” A liberal sum of money was subscribed by us for them;
it was distributed among them; they were then, with military formalities,
handed over to the local authorities, to be by them sent<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_186" id="Page_186">186</a></span>
on to the care of the British Representative at Pekin. Before being
so disposed of, they were seen by the bishop already mentioned. To
his question, “What do you now think of the Barbarian doctors?”
the answer given by one was that he could no longer fight as an
infantry soldier, but he might do so as a cavalry man; by a second,
that “he had been left upon the field dead, his wife a widow, his
children orphans. By the care shown to him, he had been lifted up
from death, fitted to return to and work for those dependent upon him;
nor had he breath in his chest sufficient to express his gratitude for it all.”</p>

<p>Among the inmates of the hospitals pertaining to our force were
some of the Sikhs who, during the advance of the army on Pekin,
had the misfortune to be taken prisoners, and subsequently subjected
to cruelties as already mentioned. Their wrists bore large cicatrices,
marking the position of the cords with which they had been so tightly
bound that ulcers in which maggots crawled were results, the agony so
great that several of their companions in misery had become delirious,
and died under it. On September 18, a party of eighteen, including
an officer, all of Fane’s Horse, were taken prisoners; of them the officer
and eight sowars succumbed under the atrocious cruelties to which
they were subjected, the remaining nine being now in <span class="locked">hospital.<a name="FNanchor_233" id="FNanchor_233" href="#Footnote_233" class="fnanchor">233</a></span> But it
would serve no good purpose to give particulars in regard to these sad
occurrences.</p>

<p>Our French allies suffered in health during the period of greatest
cold to an extent even greater than did our own men, the circumstance
being readily accounted for by the fact that the former were insufficiently
provided with warm clothing; indeed, many of them were dressed
as when on board the transport ship in which several months previous
they had been brought, <i>via</i> the Red Sea, to China. Whereas with us,
every honour was shown at the burial of such soldiers as succumbed to
the circumstances of our position, no such formality was seen by any of
us in the quarter occupied by the French; but as day by day the black
wooden crosses increased in number in their cemetery, these silent
tokens told that they too had the hand of death among them. A
temple had been converted by the French into a military hospital; the
sick accommodated therein well cared for, its administration altogether
under the Intendance, the duties of medical officers limited to professional
attendance on the patients. Among the latter was a soldier
who bore marks precisely like those of our own men already alluded
to as having been made prisoners and tortured, he having been of their
party.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_187" id="Page_187">187</a></span>
While the winter cold was most intense an epidemic of small-pox
raged among the native Chinese, and to a less degree among both the
British and French portions of our combined force. In the latter,
General Collineau, its commanding officer, was an early victim. As he
expressed himself before he lost consciousness, it was hard that after
having escaped the dangers of various campaigns, including thirty
battles, he should come to Tientsin to die of such a disease. He
entered the army as a private soldier, obtained each succeeding step
for services in the field, culminating in that of general officer for the
Italian campaign.</p>

<p>Our British soldiers suffered severely in health, and, what was remarkable,
to a greater extent than did the Sikhs, although the latter paid
less attention to warm clothing and care of their persons in other
respects than the British soldier. Our officers were affected variously;
the younger, and those who had not undergone tropical service, enjoyed
the cold weather immensely; but with those of us who had but
recently undergone the wear and tear incidental to the Mutiny campaign,
things were very different, the severity of the winter cold inducing
among us serious illness.</p>

<p class="drop-cap3"><span class="smcap1">The</span> Fraternity of Beggars constitutes one of the institutions peculiar
to Tientsin, the numbers of mendicants to be met with being
very great indeed, comprising old and young, fat and lean, the healthy,
the deformed, and the diseased. One particular class are to be seen
almost devoid of clothing on the upper part of their persons, even in
the coldest weather, when the thermometer ranges from zero to a few
degrees above, the use of thick clothing and furs by most people
considered indispensable; yet that their health in no way suffered
from such exposure was evident by their appearance. Another
notable class represent to some degree the order Flagellants, their
appeals for charity emphasized by a series of self-inflicted blows on
their bodies by means of a piece of wood or a brick-bat. These several
classes live in communities, one of which I visited. In a wretched hut,
in coldest winter, destitute of fire, thirty-five men, all in a state of
nudity, were huddled together, having a cubic space per head of 57
feet. The atmosphere was foul and offensive, the inmates for the most
part strong, and to all appearance healthy. Here, as in China generally,
the rule that “once a beggar, always a beggar,” has few, if indeed
any, exceptions.</p>

<p>An attempt was made to relieve some of the poverty and distress
which were so prominently before our eyes. For this purpose a fund
was established, a sum of eight hundred dollars being collected among
the officers of the force; the subject was brought to the notice of the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_189" id="Page_189">189</a></span>
Chinese officials and wealthier classes in the city, the result being
that they not only refused to aid the work, but opposed it in various
ways. Finally, notices were issued that the sum collected would be
distributed at the house used as a “church” by our troops; a guard of
soldiers was mounted to preserve order, and at the hour appointed seven
thousand applicants for relief had collected. Unhappily the crush
speedily became greater than the guard was capable of resisting; in the
pressure of the crowd a number of persons, chiefly women and children,
were trodden under foot, several crushed to death, and of those less
severely injured fifteen were carried into hospital.</p>

<p>As winter advanced, sickness among our troops increased to such a
degree that various <i>yamens</i> or other buildings had in succession to
be hired for that purpose. On such occasions, in addition to the
officers specially concerned in making the selection, some representative
city (Chinese) officials, the whole party under the protection of our
own military police, made an inspection of the buildings most suitable
for our purpose, after which an application was duly made for the
particular one fixed upon. On an occasion of this kind, Captain
C. E. Gordon, R.E., who shortly afterwards was to become so prominent
a character in Chinese, and subsequently in Egyptian, war-history,
formed, as usual, one of the party alluded to. In the course of our
excursion we came to what from the outside appeared to be an
eligible enclosure for our purpose. A series of loud knocks at the
outer door brought to it a neatly attired and rather good-looking
<i>boy</i>, as we at first supposed, whose manner of receiving us was the
very reverse of polite. <i>He</i> was quickly brushed aside; our party
was in act of entering, when our Chinese escort intimated the fact&mdash;&#8203;up
till that moment unexpressed&mdash;&#8203;that we were forcing our way into
a Buddhist nunnery, against the expressed objection of a nun. Our
regret was real; explanations were exchanged; we were informed that
the community within adopted male costume as an indication that they
not only renounced the world, but with it the emblems of their sex.
We were “received” by the Lady Superior, tea and cakes offered to
and partaken of by us; we were then permitted to visit the “private
chapel,” and finally we parted from the <i xml:lang="fr" lang="fr">religieuses</i> on the best of terms.
Needless to say, their establishment from that time forward was by us
held sacred.</p>

<p>A visit was made to “The Temple of Future Punishments.” That
temple comprises a series of buildings, the entrance to the general
enclosure in which they are situated having on either side a stone figure
of a dog, probably the Buddhistic ideal Cerberus. Within the several
buildings well-executed clay <i>figures</i> represented the subjects of departed<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_190" id="Page_190">190</a></span>
spirits, undergoing all the forms and degrees of punishment to which
evil Buddhists were condemned, the whole reminding us, on the one
hand, of those described in “The Vision of Meerza,” and, on the
other, of illustrations contained in at least one publication by the
Roman Catholic Church. Among the various forms of punishment so
illustrated was that of crucifixion; another illustration included the
humpless bullock, as if relating to the worship of Isis and Osiris; a
third presented the rites of the Indian Chukkur Poojah, and so on.</p>

<p>On visiting an old Buddhist temple on the left bank of the Peiho,
our reception by the priests belonging to it was most friendly and
hospitable. On the principal shrine were the orthodox representations
of “the three Buddhas,”&mdash;&#8203;namely, past, present, and to come. In
other portions of the same sacred edifice were figures, doubtless of
saints; before each a joss stick smouldered, while our venerable entertainers
talked and smiled, even in presence of their gods. This portion
of our visit over, we were invited by the priest to enter the house of
one of the brethren. Having done so, tea in small cups, and cakes,
steamed instead of baked, were served to us.</p>

<p>Arrived at a dwelling-house, in which various members of the family
were engaged in the ceremonies connected with ancestral worship, we
were permitted to be spectators of that ritual. A small shrine, erected
for the occasion, had upon it two figures, probably Confucian, for they
were without any characteristics of Buddhism. It was further decorated
with flags and other ornaments. Offerings of apples were arranged
upon the shrine; a vessel containing joss sticks, otherwise incense rods,
one of which was taken by each worshipper in his turn and lighted;
there were also piles of tinsel paper, from which pieces were successively
taken and set on fire, the belief of the worshippers, all of whom were
grave and orderly in demeanour, that messages were by that means
conveyed to their departed relatives. But there were no women present
at the ceremony. On either side of an enclosed passage, communicating
with the ancestral hall, a series of tablets, roughly estimated
at two hundred, were arranged, the impression conveyed to us being
that each ancestor has his particular day on which his worship is
celebrated.</p>

<p>We were at first unprepared, on visiting a principal mosque, to learn
that several others of less magnitude existed for the considerable
Mahomedan population in the city. The mosque alluded to was to a
great extent Chinese in external style, but within had all the usual
characteristics of such edifices; superadded to these, however, there
was, on the middle of the floor, a tablet of Confucius, around which was
entwined in bold relief the Taoist dragon! The moolahs were Chinese<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_191" id="Page_191">191</a></span>
in feature and costume, and wore the Mongolian <i>queue</i> or pigtail. As
we entered we found them deeply engaged in the study of the Koran,
written in Arabic, which language they spoke fluently.</p>

<p>Having had the honour of being invited to dinner by a Chinese
gentleman, the occasion was taken advantage of to observe the phase of
native life so presented. As guest of the evening, I was received with
much ceremony by Chang, for such was the name of the host; there
was much bowing, “chin-chin”-ing, and hand-shaking, each person for
himself shaking his own hands as he held them clasped upon his
breast. Then followed a respectful inquiry as to my honourable years,&mdash;&#8203;otherwise,
how old I was,&mdash;&#8203;and it by a desire to be informed as to how
many children had the honour to call me father, a bow and expressive
gesture indicating that sons only were to be counted in the enumeration.
All this took place in an outer apartment; the party was then
invited to proceed to the dining-hall, separated from that in which we
at first stood by a series of apartments, all handsomely furnished and
ornamented. In each corner of these rooms stood an ornamental
lantern, having in it a red-coloured taper, in token of rejoicing; on
the wall directly facing the door, a tablet upon which, in Chinese
characters, was the moral maxim, “Not to covet is a virtue,” otherwise
a compressed epitome of the tenth commandment. In the
dining-room we took the chairs assigned to us. On the table,
arranged with much taste, were dishes containing fruit, fresh and
preserved; a dish on which were some neatly cut slices of what
looked like ham; on another a pyramid of eggs that had been first
boiled hard, then permitted to remain buried in the ground for a year.
These delicacies partaken of (and the eggs referred to were by no
means nasty), our host filled the tiny cup at the side of each guest
with hot sham-shu,&mdash;&#8203;<i>i.e.</i>, a spirit distilled from millet,&mdash;&#8203;bowed to each
of us in succession, and returned to his seat. The course which
followed was mainly composed of the root of water lily (<i>Nelumbum</i>);
it again by one of sharks’ fins; then olives preserved in syrup, or
perhaps rather <span class="locked">jujubes;<a name="FNanchor_234" id="FNanchor_234" href="#Footnote_234" class="fnanchor">234</a></span> more fruits of sorts, variously preserved; seaweed,
<span class="locked">sea-slugs<a name="FNanchor_235" id="FNanchor_235" href="#Footnote_235" class="fnanchor">235</a></span>, and other delicacies. Although chop-sticks were
arranged for each of us, knives, forks, and spoons&mdash;&#8203;all of silver, but the
last-named of Chinese pattern&mdash;&#8203;were also placed for our use. Several
courses of this kind having succeeded each other, the more <i>material</i>
part of the banquet was introduced, in the shape of portions of fowl
and duck, served à la Russe; then a repetition of preserves as before;
winding up with a portion of rice&mdash;&#8203;the sign that dinner was over.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_192" id="Page_192">192</a></span>
Dessert was laid in another room; thither we repaired, and with toasts,
talk, and a good deal of festivity the evening passed away.</p>

<p>A visit to an “opium den,” and inquiries to which that visit led,
induced me to make, at the time, an entry in my diary thus: “I have
witnessed much wretchedness and want among the victims of this vice
(namely, opium-smoking); but neither in a greater degree nor among
so large a proportion of the people as are debased in the United Kingdom
through the evil consequences of indulgence in spirits.” The
institution of such establishments was at the time looked upon as
among the first fruits arising from the treaty, in accordance with which
Tientsin, as a port, has been opened to foreign shipping.</p>

<p>The visit alluded to was made in company with an American
<span class="locked">missionary.<a name="FNanchor_236" id="FNanchor_236" href="#Footnote_236" class="fnanchor">236</a></span> His plan for obtaining influence over the frequenters of
such places was to point out to them the evils present and prospective
of the vice in which they were indulging, and so endeavour to wean
them from it. By seeking for, and assisting in various ways, outcasts
and the neglected,&mdash;&#8203;by reconciling, when possible, those between whom
misunderstandings had arisen, and in other kindred methods of proceeding,
rather than in direct attempts at religious conversion, he had
succeeded in making for himself a sphere of great usefulness and
influence.</p>

<p>The postal arrangements in connection with our portion of the force
were so imperfect that only by means of Chinese messengers employed
at high rates of pay, which had to be made up at our individual
cost, our letters were conveyed to Chefoo, to be put on board a
steamer. The French, on the other hand, had with them two officers
from the Post Office in Paris, under them a party of sailors, for the
purpose, without expense to individuals, of keeping up postal communication
between Tientsin and the same port.</p>

<p>With regard also to the transmission of family remittances, a similar
contrast existed; it was impossible for us to send such remittances
otherwise than through a bank or mercantile house in Hong-Kong, at
the same time that the greatest difficulty and inconvenience existed in
sending money to that island. The French, on the contrary, have
with them special officers sent from the Paris Treasury for the purpose
of transacting business of this kind. If, therefore, our arrangements
are in most respects superior to those of our allies, these are examples
of the few in reference to which we are comparatively at a
disadvantage.</p>

<p>In the early days of April a great advance was apparent in the
aspect of vegetation; long red catkins of poplar trees hung pendulous<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_193" id="Page_193">193</a></span>
to a length of several inches; plants, numerous in their variety, rapidly
came into blossom, many being species familiar to us in England, the
progress made by all of them astonishing. Vines that had been buried
deep in long trenches, and so protected against the cold of winter, were
disinterred, laid along the surface of the ground as if to dry, then
secured upon trellis-work erected for the purpose, after which the
succession of bud, leaf, flower, and fruit was very rapid. In the near
vicinity of irrigation canals, peach trees presented lovely displays of
pink blossom; at intervals the “white cloud” of cherry flowers gave
contrast to the whole.</p>

<p>From this point onwards interest increased in observing the successive
aspects of Nature. On March 17 temperature was sufficiently
mild to bring into activity a few winged insects; a perceptible change
in the aspect of the fields was apparent; tender shoots of green cereal
leaves were rising from the ground, and tree buds began to manifest
coming activity. Migratory birds were now in flight northward in their
course, wild swans being the first to start on such a journey, and to
suffer at the hands of the snarer. Early in April the <span class="locked">swallow,<a name="FNanchor_237" id="FNanchor_237" href="#Footnote_237" class="fnanchor">237</a></span> so well
known in England, made its appearance; and thenceforward, with
White’s “Selborne” in hand, note was taken of the order in which
various species made their appearance&mdash;&#8203;an order which coincided to a
remarkable degree with what happens at home.</p>

<p>The departure of Mr. <span class="locked">Bruce<a name="FNanchor_238" id="FNanchor_238" href="#Footnote_238" class="fnanchor">238</a></span> to take up his position as British
Representative at Pekin marked the opening of a new era in the relations
between our own and the Imperial Governments. The <span class="locked">Emperor<a name="FNanchor_239" id="FNanchor_239" href="#Footnote_239" class="fnanchor">239</a></span>
was still at Jehol, whither he had fled on the approach to his capital
of the allied army; it was known that his chief adviser, the Prince Tsai,
was inimical to foreigners; that the details of government were conducted
by Prince Kung in conjunction with the Manchu Prince
Wan siang; moreover, that the Taiping rebels were carrying their
conquest rapidly northward, and so threatening the existence of the
reigning dynasty; hence it was that our force was held ready prepared
for eventualities. Happily the reception accorded to the British
Minister, if not all that could be desired, was not of a kind to call for
actual protest.</p>

<p>By way of occupation to our soldiers a camp was pitched and
temporarily occupied by them at a little distance from the city;
parades and drills became frequent, the general routine of duty much
like that in an English garrison. Men who had suffered in health
during the winter, and those time expired, were got ready for dispatch<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_194" id="Page_194">194</a></span>
homewards, being conveyed by military train waggons to Taku, and
thence by steamer to Hong-Kong <i>en route</i>. Of time-expired men the
greater number were in the best of health and vigour, inured to
military life, and in all respects desirable as soldiers, so that their
departure was a serious loss to the efficiency of our force.</p>

<p>With a view to facilitate access to the recently established camp, the
somewhat forcible measure was taken of cutting through the city wall.
That an objection should be raised by the citizens was a matter of
course; a deputation accordingly waited upon our Brigadier to protest
against the dilapidation, the reason assigned by them being that “the
Spirit of Fire” enters from the south, and danger to the city was thus to
be apprehended.</p>

<p>Intercommunication between the French and British officers was
friendly, if not exactly intimate, the former being invited to entertainments
of different kinds given by the latter. On one such occasion
conversation turned upon the nature of the influence being exerted
upon the Chinese mind by our presence respectively: “Yes,” observed
our neighbour, “we have a great mission to perform: you to benefit
them by your commerce; we (the French) by our ideas!” One
morning news reached us that a considerable portion of the French
contingent had been dispatched for service in Saigon.</p>

<p>On the subject of commerce the Chinese had already their own views
in relation to the indemnity to be paid to “the Barbarian.” Double
import duty was imposed on all foreign goods landed at the port; one
moiety to be paid before leaving the ship, the other prior to actual
landing. By this simple method, according to the expression used,
“the sheep would grow its own wool.” Not that the price to the
Chinese receiver would increase; the dues must fall upon the exporter.</p>

<p>Meanwhile the Taipings were steadily advancing in their progress of
devastation and murder; the atrocities reported as committed by them
horrible in their details. Towards the end of April, Admiral Hope and
Brigadier Staveley proceeded to Pekin, at the request of Prince Kung,
who desired to consult with them relative to a plan initiated by himself,
of dispatching a body of British troops to aid the Imperial forces
against the rebels in question. The circumstance sufficed to put all
concerned on the <i xml:lang="fr" lang="fr">qui vive</i>; our field arrangements were overhauled
and seen to; all preparations made for contingencies. Shortly afterwards
news spread that a considerable body of Tartar cavalry had
been sent from Tientsin against them; that the British were to be
withdrawn from Canton, and thus a force 2,000 strong left available
for service against the rebels.</p>

<p>Our Ambassador, finding it well to consult personally the general<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_195" id="Page_195">195</a></span>
officer commanding the troops in China respecting the somewhat
important question at this juncture, of retaining our force intact or
diminishing it, that officer was summoned to the capital. It was while
he was <i>en route</i> towards Pekin that I had the pleasure of making his
acquaintance, and of adverting to an incident already mentioned with
reference to the battle of Maharajpore. In the interval of seventeen
years which has meanwhile elapsed, Captain Mitchell, of the 6th Foot,
had become Major-General Sir John Mitchell, K.C.B. I asked him
whether he had ever received the watch sent to him from the field by
request of General Churchill. He seemed surprised to learn that I
had been the sender; and taking it from his watch-pocket exclaimed,
as he showed it to me: “There it is, and it goes as well as ever.”
The expletives which accompanied the action are here omitted.</p>

<p>As in the severity of winter the health of the troops suffered
greatly, so it did, though in a different way, when late in July and
early in August summer heat was at its highest. During the latter
period heat apoplexy, cholera, and a very virulent form of small-pox
prevailed to such an extent and with such mortality that a veritable
panic spread among them. Fortunately these terrible maladies continued
but for a short time, a change to temperate in the state of the
atmosphere seeming to put a sudden and complete check to them.
While they continued they affected only the foreigner; the Chinese
enjoyed their ordinary health; but they deviated altogether from the
method, so general in India, of protecting their heads from the heat
of the sun by means of thick turbans; on the contrary, they freely exposed
themselves to the fiercest sun with no covering whatever on their
shaven heads. According to them, the cause of this sudden outbreak
of illness was <i>the</i> comet. An immense and brilliant comet had shortly
previous appeared in the heavens&mdash;&#8203;a strikingly grand object to gaze
at, and wonder; but in the eyes of many a portent of evil.</p>

<p>Various rumours circulated with reference to the state of health
of the Emperor: that he was ill; that he was in perfect health;
that he was dead; that he had been murdered; that he was neither,
and so on. After a time authentic news of his death was received;
that, as expressed by the Chinese, “he had ascended upon the
dragon to be a guest on high”; that his son Chesiang had been
named as his successor, under the name or title of Tung-che, or
“Felicitous omen,” otherwise “Union of law and order”; that a
Board of Regency had been appointed for the conduct of government;
that its chief members, including the Empress-Dowager, were
persons of anti-foreign proclivities, the Prince Kung retaining his position
as a kind of Secretary of State for Foreign Affairs. At the date of his<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_196" id="Page_196">196</a></span>
accession the young Emperor was no more than eight years of age;
but a truly Chinese method of adding to them was adopted: his Council
<i>bestowed</i> upon him three years&mdash;&#8203;namely, one from heaven, one from
earth, and one from themselves; his age, moreover, was calculated as
having been nine months at the date of his birth.</p>

<p>A trip to Chefoo having been arranged, in company with our Brigadier-General,
Sir Charles Staveley, I proceeded by H.M. gunboat
<i>Woodcock</i> to Taku; thence by H.M.S. <i>Simoom</i>. Like many others at
Tientsin we had suffered considerably in health, first from the great
cold of winter, then from the no less trying heat of summer, with the
outbreak of epidemic disease already mentioned. Soon, however, the
open sea, with its clear air, added to complete relief from official
responsibilities and duties, had an effect for good upon us. But we
were not a little surprised to observe that while those actually ill among
the ship’s company amounted to the large proportion of 15 per cent.,
those who remained “efficient” were pale and sickly, a circumstance
attributed by their officers to their exposure to land-winds, while cruising
or at anchor in the Gulf of Pe chili.</p>

<p>Arrived at Chefoo, we landed by a roughly-built jetty, on which in
large letters was painted the word <i>Odins</i>, thus indicating the crew by
whom the work had recently been effected. We were hospitably
received by Mr. Morrison, the Consul, son of the eminent Chinese
scholar. He having provided us with horses, we were speedily away,
enjoying a ride through a tract of country remarkable for its loveliness;
the open spaces covered with brilliant flowers, while along each side of
narrow thoroughfares fruit trees at short intervals afforded us the treat
of being able to stand up in our stirrups and pluck ripening pears
as we proceeded. A second ride took us to the highest point of a
range of low hills that separates the town from the inland districts.
Thence we looked down upon a richly cultivated valley, along which
ran a stream of considerable size, itself dotted with clumps of wood, in
which were seen villages and isolated houses of agriculturists; the
sides of the valley formed for the most part of gneiss-like hills, torn at
intervals into deep and rugged ravines. In the distance inland the
view was bounded by a serrated line of mountain peaks.</p>

<p>A visit to a Taoist temple was an interesting episode in an otherwise
enjoyable excursion. The priest, apparently over seventy years of age,
received us graciously; he “chin-chinned,” shook hands&mdash;&#8203;with himself,
after the national custom; felt our arms, our legs, our feet; examined
our saddles, girths, and bridles; inquired our several ages, proffered us
glasses of water, patted the necks of our steeds; as we rode away, chin-chinned
and shook hands with himself as on our arrival. His temple,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_197" id="Page_197">197</a></span>
situated on the summit of a small hill, was erected in honour of the
North star. Near it stood two marble monuments in memory of ladies
who, though left widows while yet young, refused to re-marry; at a little
distance was a graveyard, the headstones in which were by no means
very different in style from what may be seen at home. The faces of
adjoining hills present a succession of terraces bearing abundant crops,
and watered by <i>levadas</i>, as may be seen on the island of Madeira.</p>

<p>A few days most pleasantly spent, and with health considerably improved,
we proceeded on our return journey; first by the French steamer
<i>Feilung</i>, or Flying Dragon, to the mouth of the Peiho, thence by the
French gunboat <i>l’Etoile</i> to Tientsin to resume official duties.</p>

<p>Great was the pleasure with which, early in August, we received
intimation that our “army of occupation” was to be gradually broken
up, the regiments and batteries composing it to be disposed of between
England, India, and the south of China; great the satisfaction personally
with which I received the welcome information that my connection
therewith would cease. Towards the end of September embarkation
began, detachments taken on board flats, and these towed down the
river by gunboats, each party while marching from barracks being
escorted by a band, to the strains of which&mdash;&#8203;“Auld Lang Syne” and
“The Old Folks at Home”&mdash;&#8203;they went cheerily on board, and away
from what to most of us had been a station devoid of attraction. In
this way did the second 60th embark for England, having during its
ten years of foreign service buried 300 of its members, 94 of whom in
China during the past eighteen months. This is but an example of
what “service” meant in the days referred to.</p>

<p>Next came my own turn to embark. Gladly did I proceed by H.M.
gunboat <i>Slaney</i> to the <i>Vulcan</i> at anchor off Taku, embarking Indian
troops. Captain Strode, in command, having received orders to proceed
in the first instance to Nagasaki, an unexpected opportunity thus
offered of seeing that port and city in Japan. The arm of the sea by
which the harbour is approached extends inland to a distance of six
miles, with a breadth of nearly two. On either side rises a range of
hills interrupted by valleys, the whole covered with rich forest, or with
cultivated fields, a succession of batteries being so placed as to command
the channel. To the south of us rose the island of Pappenberg;
the cliffs, 800 to 900 feet in height, are those over which, <span class="smcap smaller">A.D.</span> 1622, the
Roman Catholic “Christians” were hurled. We next arrived at Desima,
now grown into a large town, but to which locality in former times the
Dutch traders were confined by gates and narrow ways, though now
containing various houses built and in course of erection according to
European models.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_198" id="Page_198">198</a></span>
Among the places visited was the steam factory. There, under the
direction of Dutch engineers, Japanese workmen were actively employed
in the manufacture of machinery. In an adjoining dock a small
steamer was having placed in her engines, that had been thus made and
turned out; while in the harbour lay moored a steamer, the <i>Scotland</i>,
manned entirely by Japanese officers and sailors. The town of Nagasaki
was clean and tidy; very different in these respects from that whence
we had arrived. There appeared to be at least some agreeable aspects
of domestic life, inasmuch as men and women were seen partaking of
their meals together; the people were polite and civil to us foreigners,
and to myself, personally, the proprietors of a shop which I entered
to purchase various articles were so civil as to take me through several
parts of their dwelling-house, then into a neatly arranged garden
attached thereto, and in parting to beg my acceptance of a packet of
their tea, I having presented to some of the younger members a few
new silver coins, to be made by them into studs. All the while we
were being carefully watched by officials, though we were ignorant of
the fact. [How little at that time did we anticipate the amazing strides
Japan was to take during the succeeding five-and-thirty years!]</p>

<p>Arrived at Hong-Kong, my stay of a few days there was made the
more pleasant by the receipt of orders to proceed to England by the
first available opportunity, added to hospitable civility by friends whose
acquaintance I had made while stationed there the previous year.
Preparations for continuing my journey were speedily made; on November
15 I was on board the P. and O. steamer <i>Emeu</i>, from over the
stern of which, without a tinge of regret, I waved what I hoped, and
proved to be a final adieu to China.</p>

<p>Our journey was thence along the same track, but in a reverse direction
to that over which I had passed twenty months previous. Arrived
at Galle, we had, as before, to tranship, this time to the <i>Simla</i>, by
which we traversed the Indian Ocean. The season of the year permitting
us to “explore” some of the sights of Aden, we took advantage
of the opportunity afforded by the brief delay of our ship at the anchorage.
Driving through the narrow cut in the hard lava rock,&mdash;&#8203;that had
in distant time formed the wall of an active volcano,&mdash;&#8203;we were at the
cantonments, situated in the ancient crater; thence to the reservoirs,
originally erected <i>in</i> the face of perpendicular rock, their design and
construction due to Persian engineers, dating from <span class="smcap smaller">A.D.</span> 600. Our drive
was next through a narrow gorge, opening towards the south, admitting
the only breeze that can directly reach cantonments. From its
outer limit a view was obtained of the open sea, and of the small island
upon which, according to Arab tradition, Cain was forced to reside<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_199" id="Page_199">199</a></span>
after his murder of Abel. Continuing our excursion, we arrived at the
fortification known as “The Turkish Wall,” that protects and defends
the isthmus connecting “the rock” with the mainland. The shops on the
beach were visited, and purchases made at some of them; among such
purchases, ostrich feathers, here so common as to be used to decorate
the heads of donkeys driven by Arab boys.</p>

<p>The people met with comprised Parsees, Somalis, Jews, and Egyptians.
The Jews and Egyptians said to be descendants of those who fled
to Egypt on the invasion of Palestine and Egypt by <span class="locked">Nebuchadnezzar;<a name="FNanchor_240" id="FNanchor_240" href="#Footnote_240" class="fnanchor">240</a></span>
the Somalis supposed to be descended from former Abyssinian possessors
of “Yemen,” or that part of Arabia to which Aden belongs, or
rather did belong. Other historical items relating to Aden include its
early importance as an <i xml:lang="fr" lang="fr">entrepôt</i> of commerce between the Roman
Empire and the East; in recent times the capture of the position by the
British in January, 1839, it being the first military conquest effected in
the reign of Her Majesty Queen Victoria.</p>

<p>To most of us the news we received on arriving at Suez was a surprise;
namely, that which speedily became known as the <i>Trent</i> affair. Some
particulars reached us also regarding the action present and intended
of the English Government and War Office, the immediate effect being
to lead us to anticipate active service within a very short time. Here
we were quickly landed, distributed in railway carriages, and so sent on
to Cairo, at which place another brief detention awaited us. I accordingly
reverted under the guidance of my former dragoman, Hadji Selim,
to the excursions previously interrupted by my departure eastward;
visiting, among other places of interest, the ancient Coptic Church,
erected, according to tradition, upon the cave in which, during their
flight into Egypt, Mary and the infant Saviour took shelter one night.
Thence, continuing our railway journey, we reached Alexandria,
arriving there in a storm of such violence that to embark was impossible;
consequently another halt was unavoidable. I took advantage of
the occasion, in defiance of wind and rain, to visit some of the places
of historical interest pertaining to this very interesting city, including
the site of the ancient Pharos, Pompey’s Pillar, and “Cleopatra’s”
<span class="locked">Needle,<a name="FNanchor_241" id="FNanchor_241" href="#Footnote_241" class="fnanchor">241</a></span> the latter prostrate in and almost covered by the sand; also,
what was indicated as “St. Mark’s pulpit.” Time did not admit of a
visit to the ruined aqueduct, of which, however, we obtained a glance
while nearing the city.</p>

<p>Here the unexpected news reached us that the Prince Consort had<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_200" id="Page_200">200</a></span>
succumbed to fever; that national sympathy was felt for the Queen
under her bereavement, as well as sorrow and regret at the event, more
particularly at a time when political matters throughout Europe, and in
reference to America, were in a very disturbed condition.</p>

<p>From Alexandria the journey was performed by the <i>Ceylon</i>, comfortably,
and without adventure. At Malta we learned that the American
Congress had expressed approval of the Southern minister being captured
on board a British <span class="locked">steamer;<a name="FNanchor_242" id="FNanchor_242" href="#Footnote_242" class="fnanchor">242</a></span> that troops were being prepared in
England for immediate embarkation; that war appeared imminent and
inevitable. On reaching Gibraltar we found in the bay the Mediterranean
fleet, in which it was said all necessary preparations were being
made for active service. Our entrance to the Bay of Biscay was duly
announced by the ship’s band with the well-known air so called.
Warlike news greeted us on arrival at Southampton. Then followed, in
quick succession, disembarkation, personal report at Headquarters,
London, appointment to Devonport, and happy reunion to wife and
children there.</p>

<p class="drop-cap5"><span class="smcap1">Administrative</span> duties in the Western Military District of
England, of which Devonport was, and still is, the Headquarters,
were peaceful, and so contrasted with events during the past few years,
as already recorded. In due time&mdash;&#8203;the first for several years&mdash;&#8203;I applied
for and obtained the usual two months’ leave accorded annually
to officers serving at home. With my wife I proceeded to Paris, where
time passed agreeably and profitably in visiting places of historical,
artistic, and scientific interest, and in exploring public buildings and
monuments with which that very beautiful city abounds.</p>

<p>On that occasion the French capital was <i xml:lang="fr" lang="fr">en fête</i>, the King of Holland
being on a visit to Napoleon the Third; military displays on a grand
scale the order of the day. One such display being arranged to take
place at Versailles, we joined the crowds proceeding thither from St.
Lazare. Having visited the château and its surroundings, we had the
opportunity, while in the latter, of meeting the young Prince Imperial,
then little more than seven years old, as he rode a small pony, accompanied
and guarded by a group of attendants. Within the château we
visited the various salons open to the public, among them the Salon de
la Guerre and Grande Galerie des Glaces, little thinking as we did so
that they were to be revisited under very different circumstances.</p>

<p>An important “function,” at which we “assisted,” was a grand review
at the Champ de Mars, where 40,000 troops paraded for the purpose,
accompanied by an imposing military train, and an efficient-looking
pontoon train. The precision with which the various battalions and<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_202" id="Page_202">202</a></span>
other bodies of troops took up their assigned positions was striking,
giving to a looker-on the impression of a high state of efficiency. With
the Champ de Mars I was to become unpleasantly acquainted eight
years subsequently.</p>

<p>During our visit an incident took place which may be mentioned in
these notes. While at the <i xml:lang="fr" lang="fr">table d’hôte</i><a name="FNanchor_243" id="FNanchor_243" href="#Footnote_243" class="fnanchor">243</a> one morning I got into conversation
with a lady whose seat adjoined my own. In the course of talk
the subject of the late expedition to China being alluded to, she mentioned
the name of the officer whose death at Hong-Kong has been
already recorded. I related to her some of the particulars already
given, among others his request that I should destroy the mysterious
parcel, and the fulfilment by me of that his dying request. As I did
so, the lady seemed surprised; she informed me that her daughter,
then seated at her left side, had been engaged to Captain M&mdash;&mdash;&#8203;, and
she doubted not that the parcel in question contained the letters of the
fair <i>fiancée</i>, whose health had given way, and on whose account both
were now travelling.</p>

<p>A short but very pleasant visit over, I took leave of the fascinating
capital, little thinking of the conditions under which my acquaintance
with it was to become more intimate a few years thereafter. On our
homeward journey a short stay was made at Rouen. To us that city
had several points of interest, including its traditional association with
the closing scene in the life of Joan of Arc, with its attendant barbarities;
and as the capital whence William started on his conquest
of England, the Caserne de Bonnes Nouvelles now occupying the site
of the palace where Matilda received “the good news” of that conquest.
Interesting also in that its cathedral contains the heart of
Richard Cœur de Lion, together with a monument to that monarch.
But the edifice which seemed to us the architectural gem was the
church of St. Ouen, dating, it was said, from <span class="smcap smaller">A.D.</span> 533, and in its
present form from 1318; with its numerous windows of stained glass,
its western portal and arcade, its sculptured vase, from the surface of
the “holy” water contained in which a reflected view is seen of the
roof through its entire extent, including the exquisite workmanship of
its ornamentation.</p>

<p>Returned to duty at Devonport, an intimation soon reached me that
I was again to proceed on foreign service. A few days sufficed to make
the necessary arrangements for my dear wife, who, with the children,
must be left behind. Then came in quick succession orders to embark
for Calcutta; then the very painful ordeal of leave-taking; then embarkation<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_203" id="Page_203">203</a></span>
at Southampton on board the P. and O. ss. <i>Ripon</i>, September
4, 1862, and away from England for a sixth tour abroad.</p>

<p>Arrived at Calcutta, I was appointed to administrative charge of the
Presidency and Benares divisions, the duties connected with the former
including charge of the office of Inspector-General, and inspections of
all ships arriving or departing with troops, all those combined functions
being of a much more arduous nature than at the time I was
able to appreciate.</p>

<p>The cold season had set in, and with its advent the usual influx
of higher officials to the Indian capital. Lord Elgin, recently
appointed Governor-General, carried with him sympathetic feeling
towards those who had lately served in China, and in this spirit extended
his civility to myself, as to some others who had but lately
arrived. It was while partaking of Viceregal hospitality that I met
Admiral Sir James Hope, who had given such material help to the
hospital for Chinese we had established at Tientsin. With him I discussed
the question mooted in China of establishing at Nagasaki
a sanatorium for invalid soldiers and sailors employed at various places
on, and in vessels off, the coast; but, as I think unfortunately for both
those classes, the proposal never came to anything.</p>

<p>The unusual <i xml:lang="fr" lang="fr">mélange</i> of subjects which gave rise to comment in
Calcutta at the same time was in its way remarkable. The ex-King of
Delhi had very recently died at Rangoon. The King of Greece was
reported to have abdicated, and together with his queen fled from his
kingdom. A crisis had occurred in Prussia. The Emperor of Austria
was about to be crowned as King of Hungary. In America, a Proclamation
had declared the emancipation of the slaves, various reports
reaching us of threatened risings and other complications as outcomes of
that measure. In the columns of some English journals, strong comments
with regard to British policy in China in taking military action
against the Taiping rebels. In Japan, a revolution, the city of Yedo
destroyed by the insurgents. In the Straits of Corea, the Russians induced
to abandon the island, of which they had quietly taken possession
during the earlier stages of the Anglo-French expedition against China.
Garibaldi wounded; a consultation of surgeons as to whether the bullet
was in the wound or not&mdash;&#8203;one would think, not a very difficult enigma
to solve by men of experience in the field. The coming of age of the
Prince of Wales, together with the honours and promotions announced
on that auspicious occasion. The nomination of Prince Alfred to the
throne of Greece. The proposed mediation by France between the
Northern and Southern States of America, and failure of that attempt.
The endeavours made to diminish as far as possible difficulties into<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_204" id="Page_204">204</a></span>
which Lancashire weavers had fallen. Such are a few of the outside
matters to which conversation in Calcutta was directed.</p>

<p>Among those more nearly connected with India was the report contained
in the home papers of the Court-Martial&mdash;&#8203;at the time notorious&mdash;&#8203;having
reference to the circumstances under which the death took place
of the Sergeant-Major of the 6th Dragoons at Mhow. A very unpleasant
incident at a Service Club was the subject of comment; the
action taken with regard to it by the officer in chief command being
discussed in terms more energetic than flattering. Towards the end
of the cold season the ceremony took place of consecrating the well at
Cawnpore into which were thrown the victims of the saddest of all sad
episodes connected with the Mutiny of 1857.</p>

<p>There seemed to be a lull in the current of events in India; but not
in those relating to various European nations, and to America. The
insurrection which for some time past has been in progress in Poland
was said to have assumed increased proportions. In England, the
approaching marriage of the Prince of Wales was the subject of loyal
excitement throughout the country. In America renewed endeavours
to bring about cessation of the Civil War had so far proved futile.</p>

<p>With the advance of the hot season came the usual influx of sick
officers from the interior, on their way home if possible, or to be treated
in the hospital provided for their care by the Indian Government.
Among them the story of one was very sad, and at the same time illustrative
of that of many others. Brought to a hotel, together with his
wife, a girl in age, he was found, when first seen by a medical officer, to
be dying, consciousness all but gone; his wife unaware of his actual
condition; both without friend or even acquaintance in Calcutta.
There was no time for delay or ceremony. I accordingly informed her at
once how desperate was his state, asking at the same time if she knew
what was the position of his worldly affairs. Her reply: “Not more
than the child unborn.” I led her to the couch of the expiring man,
and asked directly, “Where is your will?” He muttered rather than
intelligibly expressed a reply, which seemed, however, to give his young
wife the requisite indication. Within an hour thereafter he was dead.
The widow and her infant had to be left for the time being in the
apartment immediately adjoining that in which lay the corpse of her
husband, until, with the Indian hospitality of that day, a resident family
were communicated with, and sent their carriage for her and her infant;
both of whom were cared for until arrangements were completed, and
the bereaved ones some weeks thereafter sailed for England.</p>

<p>A good deal of talk was current in reference to two noted State trials
of chiefs who had taken an active part in murders and other atrocities<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_205" id="Page_205">205</a></span>
committed in connection with the Mutiny, but who had only recently
come within the clutches of the law, notably at Lucknow and Bombay.
At this time emissaries of the Nana were believed to be actively at
work, the general impression being that he was alive and in Nepaul,
whence he continued to issue instructions to sympathisers.</p>

<p>The near prospect of the canal across the Isthmus of Suez being
completed, as well as some other considerations, led to a reconsideration
by the authorities of the general question relating to the transport
of troops between England and India, and <i>vice versâ</i>. Experience had
recently shown the inconvenience and military objections against the
long sea route <i>via</i> the Cape, including the long period during which to
all intents and purposes troops in transit are non-effective. Statistics
had so far been unfavourable in regard to the results obtained by sending
to hill “sanatoria” soldiers suffering from organic illness. These
circumstances were deemed of sufficient importance to justify inquiry
into the whole matter, the outcome of the investigation being a scheme
in accordance with which a line of Indian troopships was some time
thereafter established.</p>

<p>Several circumstances combined to occupy public as well as official
attention. The death of Dost Mahomed was followed by fratricidal
wars between his sons; these conflicts were to continue during the
next few years, and become historically interesting because of the policy
of “masterly inactivity” observed towards the contending parties.
Relations between England and Russia were in a strained condition;
with Japan so unsatisfactory that the dispatch thither of a military force
was contemplated. A certain amount of excitement was kept alive by
rumours, more or less plausible, that the Nana was alive and active; first
one suspect and then another was captured, but only to be set at
liberty by judicial authority.</p>

<p>The dispatch of the 43rd Light Infantry for service in New Zealand
was in Calcutta looked upon as quite an important event; arrangements
for transport presented no difficulty whatever, but it was impossible
to provide the regiment with equipment of a kind suitable for
the service on which they were proceeding, for however well adapted
for the circumstances of India is that authorized by regulations of the
country, it is ill adapted for others in which camels and elephants as
beasts of burthen are unobtainable.</p>

<p>From different parts of India came reports of disaffection, while from
some, including Sittana, came accounts of actual outbreaks&mdash;&#8203;<i>fanatical</i>,
they were called. Early in October information reached us that under
Admiral Kuper the British fleet had opened fire upon and destroyed
the forts at Kagosima, though not without heavy loss to his own officers<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_206" id="Page_206">206</a></span>
and men. Orders had been issued in England for the dispatch of
reinforcements thither, and instructions to the same effect have been
received by the Government of India.</p>

<p>In course of duty I visited the several stations within the divisions
already named at which British troops were quartered, renewing
acquaintance with places formerly well known, and connected with
which were various associations, pleasant and otherwise. Of such
places were the jungle road leading from Arrah to Jugdispore, so
familiar in connection with service there; Beehea, where our force was
suddenly attacked by Koer Singh’s rebel sepoys; Jounpore, through the
streets of which city in dead of night our field force marched towards
what proved to be a somewhat severe action at Teegra, listening as we
proceeded to the sound of “grinders” at their “mills,” by which alone
silence was broken; Azimghur, with the compound in which under fire
from sepoy rifles we bivouacked, the line of march, and scene of action
by our force against the besieging mutineers.</p>

<p>On that tour of inspection duty the journey from Dinapore to
Darjeeling was attended by incidents of which the following are examples:&mdash;&#8203;A
hitch and consequent delay in regard to transit arrangements;
several hours by railway train; a night spent in a wattle-and-daub
hut called a dâk bungalow; twenty odd miles by steamer on the
Ganges; starting by palanqueen; a break-down; return on foot
several miles to the place whence I had so proceeded; delay and
trouble in obtaining another conveyance of the same kind; another
start; a short rest in the house of a hospitable civil servant; then on
by raised causeway through a long tract of swampy ground; rowed
across a broad nullah, and then the land journey resumed. After a
little the discovery was made that the carrier of the luggage had
dropped out of sight, nor could his whereabouts be discovered. On
arriving at the “stage” where a relay of bearers was expected, there
were none in waiting; the old ones heavily bribed continued, but at a
slow pace, with many intervals to rest and indulge in smoking. Two
more stages had to be got over in much the same manner, and then on
reaching the rest house at the foot of the ascent towards Darjeeling, no
provision whatever had been made for progress onward. Starting on
foot, some four or five miles were got over, when meeting a native leading
a small horse, or tat, bare backed, without halter or other substitute
than a rope around its neck, I mounted the animal, but unable to
guide it, had to resume walking, and so in time got over twenty out
of the thirty miles that separate Punkabaree from the popular hill
station. Railway transit between Calcutta and Darjeeling was in the
far future.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_207" id="Page_207">207</a></span>
In the near vicinity of Darjeeling numerous hillmen were employed
improving and remodelling the road along which my walk lay. The
general aspect presented by them was miserable and unpleasant.
Tartar in feature and costume, the majority distinguished by <i>queue</i> or
“pigtail”; many affected with goitre, others with large foul ulcers on
legs or feet, unprotected by dressing of any kind,&mdash;&#8203;the ulcers said to
result from wounds inflicted by a poisonous fly abundantly met with
here and hereabout.</p>

<p>In the early hours of the following morning a magnificent view of the
snowy range, including the peaks of Mount Everest and Kinchinjunga
was obtained, all reflecting brilliantly the first rays of sunlight, but later
on becoming obscured by mist.</p>

<p>An experimental station for troops had some few years previously
been established at Sinchal, situated on a mountain spur about a thousand
feet higher than Darjeeling itself. Thither I went in course of
duty, but only to learn how hateful the place was to officers and men
quartered there, isolated, and for the most part concealed in cloud or
mist as it was, the atmosphere damp, cold, and chilly. That the experiment
was a failure was evident, but some time had yet to elapse before
it was so acknowledged officially, and abandoned.</p>

<p>Situated in a deep valley, ten or twelve miles from Darjeeling, and
at a level of four thousand feet below that station, are the mineral wells
of Nunsook; the intervening spurs and ranges for the most part under
cultivation with tea, coffee, or cinchona. Between us and the wells the
Rungnoo River rushed in curling foam along its rocky bed, leaping as it
went, as a cascade of considerable height and volume. Crossing that
stream by a wooden bridge, then ascending among the rocks to a little
distance, we reached the object of our journey. So deep and narrow
is the mountain rent in which the chalybeate spring issues from the
rock, that sunlight reaches it during no more than two hours daily. In
its immediate neighbourhood was a hut in which a few British soldiers
were accommodated, also “experimentally” to test the beneficial
qualities of the spring. No wonder that they wished themselves with
their regiment, or anywhere except at the well of Nunsook.</p>

<p>Another excursion was to the valley of the Rungeet River, some fourteen
miles distant from Darjeeling, and forming the boundary between
British India and Sikkim. The descent is steep; as we proceeded
we met numbers of hillmen toiling upwards, bearing heavy loads in
<i>kalbas</i> or baskets upon their backs&mdash;&#8203;women were similarly engaged&mdash;&#8203;the
goods so carried consisting in a great part of borax, spices, and other
“fragrant” substances, including asafœtida,&mdash;&#8203;some of the people so
fair that a rosy tint was on their faces. As we descended into the deep<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_208" id="Page_208">208</a></span>
and narrow valley the snowy range, at first so prominent an object,
became lost to view, precipices shut us in on either side, trees of great
size rising from ledges or projecting from crevices. The Rungeet
rushed as a large green-coloured stream along its rugged bed, at short
intervals curling in white foam as it eddied around rocks or leaped in
cascades over ledges; at a short distance from where we now were it
joins the Rungnoo, the united stream so formed being the Teesta,
which finally discharges itself into the Brahmapootra. Crossing the
Rungeet by what seemed a very frail and unsteady bridge of <span class="locked">cane,<a name="FNanchor_244" id="FNanchor_244" href="#Footnote_244" class="fnanchor">244</a></span> we
arrived in Sikkim, the span of the construction by which we did so
being two hundred feet, the roaring torrent rushing beneath us. Such
was the character of one part of the sphere in which in 1861 military
operations had to be conducted against that region, including the
transport of guns and supplies.</p>

<p>The return journey from Darjeeling was in some respects little less
unpleasant than that to it had been. Arrived at Raneegunge, it became
necessary to proceed towards the station of Hazarabagh, and for that
purpose to take “garry” along some part of the Grand Trunk Road, by
which in 1859 I had marched with the 10th Foot when <i>en route</i> for
England. In the course of that journey crowds of pilgrims were
encountered, each bearing upon his forehead the distinctive mark of
the Hindoo sect to which he belonged, and carrying the pilgrim’s
gourd so familiar to us in mediæval pictures; all were devout in aspect
and manner; some performing penance by crawling on hands and
knees&mdash;&#8203;a mode of progression by which the distance daily got over by
them was said to be about one mile. And yet the majority of them
had come from Ajudiah (Fyzabad), and were on their way to Juggurnath.</p>

<p>Two days thereafter I traversed a flight of locusts. Seen from a distance
the mass looked somewhat like a snow shower in a clear sunshiny
day, the apparent breadth of the flight over a mile, its length six or
eight; the road and bare soil on either side completely covered by
those that had fallen or alighted; the sound made by those still on the
wing distinct and rustling. The conditions alluded to in this and the
preceding paragraph illustrate those which existed while railways were
in their early stages.</p>

<p>The arrival of my beloved wife on December 13 was an event to
be chronicled, though for the time being a boarding-house was the substitute
for the <i>home</i> to which I could take her. Like so many other
ladies similarly situated, she had to place her children at school as best<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_209" id="Page_209">209</a></span>
she could, and then take leave of them to join her husband in India.
The necessity of so parting with one’s children is one of the greatest
drawbacks of service in India, or indeed anywhere in the tropics; it is
lamented by all who are affected by it, and by none more than by
ourselves. And yet it is unavoidable. Various instances illustrative
of unsatisfactory results arising out of this necessity occur to the mind
of most men of experience, not the least being that sons and daughters
are thrown more or less at haphazard upon those whose method and
manner of training is destined to determine the style of their own
lives and the relations in which they are to stand with their parents.</p>

<p>The somewhat sudden death of Lord Elgin, while on tour, was
followed by very general expression of sympathy; among those who
had been associated with him in China, and so had opportunities of
estimating his amiable and upright character, the sentiment was one
of regret and esteem. But in India, as elsewhere&mdash;&#8203;<i xml:lang="fr" lang="fr">le Roi est mort;
Vive le Roi</i>. Sir John Lawrence arrived from England ere many weeks
were over; was received by a guard of honor; duly sworn in, and
matters official proceeded in their ordinary course.</p>

<p>For the first time, and as an experiment, an Agricultural Exhibition
was organized and took place. The variety of animals brought from
all parts of British India was great; so was that of native contributors
and visitors; but there was reason to believe that lively interest on the
part of the latter was sadly lacking; they thought of the entire proceeding
in the light of a mere <i>tomashah</i>, or “hubbub,” and nothing
more.</p>

<p>In the further north,&mdash;&#8203;namely, on the Sittana frontier,&mdash;&#8203;the “rising”
among some tribes of that region had just been suppressed; that
favourable end attained in part by means of a military expedition, in
part by persuasion, otherwise diplomacy.</p>

<p>Experience had long taught residents in Lower Bengal that the period
of early spring is that when cholera is most to be dreaded, alike in
respect to the suddenness of its attack and its fatality. The 55th
Regiment, recently arrived and temporarily encamped at Raneegunge,
became somewhat severely attacked by that scourge. Various instances
of sudden death occurred from the same cause among old Calcutta
residents, and the health of others began to droop; among them
my wife.</p>

<p>Soon after the direct government of India had been assumed by the
Crown, a Royal Commission was appointed to inquire into sanitary
questions relating chiefly to the British troops in that dependency, and
also to the native population, whether in cities, villages, or rural
districts; their deliberations were necessarily protracted. In due course<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_210" id="Page_210">210</a></span>
their report was published, and now the new Governor-General issued
the necessary orders for the appointment, in Calcutta, of a Commission
to give effect to their recommendations, familiarly referred to as the
Thirty-nine Articles, that being their number. On that Commission I
was appointed to <span class="locked">serve.<a name="FNanchor_245" id="FNanchor_245" href="#Footnote_245" class="fnanchor">245</a></span> It began its labours with enthusiasm, in the
belief that by measures to be recommended by it the havoc by sickness
and death to which our troops had been subject during the long
period of our hold on India were to be materially lessened, their
condition generally improved. At this date the number of soldiers
required to fill the vacancies so caused amounted to 240 per week, and
this we hoped to reduce considerably.</p>

<p>Among the <span class="locked">Wahabees<a name="FNanchor_246" id="FNanchor_246" href="#Footnote_246" class="fnanchor">246</a></span> of India there existed widespread spirit of
disaffection, Patna and Dacca being two important centres of its
propagation. From Europe came news of war between Denmark on
the one hand, Austria and Prussia on the other; the combined armies
being in occupation of Schleswig. That America had claimed from
England indemnity for losses inflicted by the <i>Alabama</i><a name="FNanchor_247" id="FNanchor_247" href="#Footnote_247" class="fnanchor">247</a> on the plea
that as “290” she was built in a British dockyard. The request of
the Pekin Government for British officers to act against the Taipings
being acceded to, the list of those so “lent” included the name of
Major C. G. Gordon, R.E., whose remarkable career had thus its
starting point. From New Zealand came, unhappily, news of misfortune
to the regiment recently dispatched from Calcutta to take part
against the Maoris.</p>

<p>On the invitation of a <span class="locked">friend<a name="FNanchor_248" id="FNanchor_248" href="#Footnote_248" class="fnanchor">248</a></span> we proceeded to his indigo factory,
and so had an opportunity of obtaining some interesting particulars
with regard to that industry, the actual origin of which in India, seems
to have been due to civil servants of the East India Company. South
America is the region to which the growth and manufacture of the
plant and dye originally pertained. When introduced into India, the
cultivators grew it simply at the request of the civilian in his particular
district, and for the profit of the latter; after a time overseers were
employed, but as in those days the presence of “interlopers” was
discouraged by the local government, the class of persons employed
was not such as to exert upon the natives that moral influence which
would have been beneficial as it was desirable. This state of things
after a time gave place to a better; the presence of adventurers, as<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_211" id="Page_211">211</a></span>
all who belonged not to the Indian service were called, had to be
recognised, and so the indigo industry fell into the hands of men
belonging to the middle class of British society. Then came what has
ever since been looked upon as class legislation, the effect of which is
considered to have been friction and disaccord between cultivators and
planters.</p>

<p>One of the most severe hurricanes recorded in this part of India
occurred on the night of October 7; the devastation caused by it on
land, at sea, and in the river Hooghly, being great and extensive.
Off Calcutta ships were driven from their moorings and wrecked;
in some instances in tiers. So high did the storm-wave rise that
the river overflowed the high embankment, carrying with it one
or two vessels, one of which was left stranded near the Botanic
Gardens; many houses were damaged, some completely destroyed;
trees in all directions were prostrated, among them the once famous
“duelling tree,” under the shade of which in early morning “meetings”
took place in days not long past, and “honour” was satisfied&mdash;&#8203;at
the distance of twelve paces.</p>

<p>Regarding hurricanes, the first of which definite record is available
swept over Calcutta in 1737. An extremely violent one happened in
1821, on which occasion the storm-wave covered Saugor Island,
destroying immense numbers of people, cattle, and wild animals.
Another took place in 1842, then in 1851, and now in 1864, indicating
something like a cycle, varying from eleven to thirteen years
between their occurrence.</p>

<p>The significance of some among the public events alluded to in
the preceding notes transpired in years subsequent to their actual
occurrence; the following brief summary relating to the chief performers
in that drama is accordingly given here. From the death
of Dost <span class="locked">Mahomed,<a name="FNanchor_249" id="FNanchor_249" href="#Footnote_249" class="fnanchor">249</a></span> in June, 1863, till September, 1868, his third son,
Sheer Ali Khan, who, with the sanction of the Government of India,
succeeded him on the throne of Affghanistan, passed through a very
stormy time. His two elder brothers, Afzul and Azim, and his nephew,
Abdur Rahman (the present ruler), were in revolt against him. His<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_212" id="Page_212">212</a></span>
favourite son and heir-apparent, Ali Khan, was killed in action in 1865.
In 1866 he was defeated near Ghazni by Abdar Rahman, who released
his father, Afzul, from prison, into which he had been cast by Sheer Ali,
led him in triumph to Cabul, and proclaimed him Amir of Affghanistan.
Afzul at once wrote to the Government of India, expressing a hope
that as such the friendship of the British would be extended to him.
He was informed in reply that the Government of Sir John Lawrence
recognised him only as Ruler of Cabul; that as Sheer Ali held Kandahar
and Herat, existing engagements with the latter could not be broken
off. Afzul and Azim thereupon directed the Waziri chiefs in attendance
at Court, together with the envoy, who had come from Swat to pay
respects to the new Amir, to set on foot a holy war against the English,
while an emissary was sent on a secret mission to Russia. In 1867
Sheer Ali was again defeated near Khelat-i-Ghilsie, and lost Kandahar.
On this fact being communicated to the Government of India, Afzul
Khan was in his turn recognised as Amir of Cabul and Kandahar, Sir
John Lawrence at the same time informing him that the British Government
intended to maintain a strict neutrality between the contending
parties in Affghanistan. This policy on the part of the Governor-General
was at the time called, often in sarcastic terms, “masterly
<span class="locked">inactivity.”<a name="FNanchor_250" id="FNanchor_250" href="#Footnote_250" class="fnanchor">250</a></span> Under the circumstances of the time, such public opinion
as found expression in Calcutta approved of the policy in question.
But neither to Afzul nor Azim was that policy satisfactory. They sent
a copy of the letter conveying the decision of Sir John Lawrence to the
Russian Governor of Tashkend, who was informed by Afzul that he had
no confidence in the “Lord Sahib’s” fine professions of friendship; that
he was disgusted with the British Government for the ingratitude and
ill-treatment shown towards his brother Azim, who, it was asserted,
had encouraged his father, Dost Mahomed Khan, not to disturb the
Peshawur frontier during the Mutiny.</p>

<p class="drop-cap3"><span class="smcap1">Visiting</span> Patna in the course of duty, I was present in the court
of the magistrate while Ahmed oola Khan, the suspected originator
of the Sittana rebellion, was undergoing preliminary examination
on a charge of sedition. For thirty years he had been suspected; yet
he held a high position under the Indian Government, at one time as a
member of the Board of Instruction, then a member of the Municipal
Commission, and lastly a Commissioner of the Income Tax. During
the Mutiny the Local Commissioner had reason to doubt his fidelity,
and reported to Government the grounds upon which his suspicions
were founded, the only result as stated at the time being censure for
having given expression to them.</p>

<p>An official visit to Monghyr gave me the opportunity of driving to
Seeta Khoond, in the near vicinity of that place. The spring so
named has a temperature of 180° F., and is one of several in this part
of India; but chiefly interesting in that the high priest of the temple
connected therewith repeated to us its legendary association with the
story of Rama and <span class="locked">Seeta,<a name="FNanchor_251" id="FNanchor_251" href="#Footnote_251" class="fnanchor">251</a></span> in terms very similar to what a few days
before I had read in a compressed edition of the <i>Ramayana</i>.
Here then is the record transmitted traditionally through many<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_214" id="Page_214">214</a></span>
generations of a more or less mythical event, the date of which
considerably preceded that of Homer.</p>

<p>As an experiment, barracks for a small number of British soldiers
were erected on the summit of Parisnath, in the hope that its elevation
of 4,530 feet above sea level might exert a favourable influence on
their health. A narrow pathway had recently been cut through the
<span class="locked">forest<a name="FNanchor_252" id="FNanchor_252" href="#Footnote_252" class="fnanchor">252</a></span> by which the hill is covered. Ascending by it we traverse
several precipitous ridges, between which deep and thickly wooded
valleys intervene. Voices of many birds are heard as we proceed;
among them the crow of jungle cock and scream of the <span class="locked">coel;<a name="FNanchor_253" id="FNanchor_253" href="#Footnote_253" class="fnanchor">253</a></span> black
squirrels and lungoors dash rapidly from branch to branch, downwards
into the forest beneath us.</p>

<p>Parisnath is the Sinai of the <span class="locked">Jains.<a name="FNanchor_254" id="FNanchor_254" href="#Footnote_254" class="fnanchor">254</a></span> On its summit are twenty-two
temples pertaining to that sect, the largest consecrated to their
chief deity, Parisnath, whence the name of the hill. Numerous
pilgrims visit the shrines, more especially in the month of <i>Poos</i>, or
November.</p>

<p>There are those who believe&mdash;&#8203;with what measure of authority I
know not&mdash;&#8203;that an immigrant tribe from the vicinity of the hill in
question having settled in ancient Greece, transferred the name of their
sacred mountain to <span class="locked">“Parnassus.”<a name="FNanchor_255" id="FNanchor_255" href="#Footnote_255" class="fnanchor">255</a></span> The legend may be on a par with
that in accordance with which the name of Sevastopol is made to
signify “The Place of Siva.”</p>

<p>For some time past unpleasantness had been breeding with regard to
Bhootan; endeavours were made to come to a peaceful understanding
with the chiefs concerned, but these having ended in failure, the
dispatch thither of a military expedition was resolved <span class="locked">on.<a name="FNanchor_256" id="FNanchor_256" href="#Footnote_256" class="fnanchor">256</a></span> In the
early part of the cold season a combined force of British and native
troops was equipped, and proceeded on service to that territory, a chief
reason for sending white troops being a report that considerable misconduct
on the part of sepoys at Dewangiri had reached the authorities,
the circumstance furnishing a suggestive commentary on action recently
taken to materially increase the native army.</p>

<p>On March 4 an event occurred which, in its importance to India,
should be mentioned: the first direct telegraphic message from London<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_215" id="Page_215">215</a></span>
was delivered in Calcutta, it having taken three days to reach
its destination. As a painful coincidence, Colonel Stewart, to whom
the public are indebted for the completion of that undertaking, died
just as the work had been finished. Hitherto the telegrams received
came through several lines.</p>

<p>The hot season this year set in unusually early; it was severe and
protracted, sickness and death making havoc among all classes of
foreigners, more especially our soldiers. Medical officers, like others,
were prostrated in great numbers, the result being that those who
remained fit for duty had much extra work thrown upon them. The
establishment in India being so closely kept down so as to meet only
ordinary requirements, it is inadequate when the demands become considerable,
whether on account of epidemic or field service.</p>

<p>In July duty took me to Hazarabagh. The rains were on, the roads
soft, and in many places submerged. On my return journey, detention
for several hours at night in dense jungle was occasioned by the Siranee
River being in flood, and impassable. The result of that exposure was
a severe attack of illness, by which for two months I was prostrated and
altogether incapacitated for work. Having hitherto avoided making an
application for privilege leave, I now submitted such a request, but with
the unlooked-for result that it met with a refusal&mdash;&#8203;the fact that it did so
illustrating the attitude of departmental seniors towards their juniors in
those days. With reluctance I felt under the necessity of applying for
a medical certificate, on which, as a matter of course, I obtained leave
of absence.</p>

<p>At the time referred to, the Neilgherry hills were more get-at-able
from Calcutta than were the Himalayahs; <span class="locked">our<a name="FNanchor_257" id="FNanchor_257" href="#Footnote_257" class="fnanchor">257</a></span> means of transit, by
steamer to Madras, train thence to Coimbatore, bullock bandy or cart
to Metapollium, hammock or pony to Ootacamund. The ascent of the
ghat presents a succession of strikingly beautiful views, precipitous
cliffs, mountain ascents clothed by dense forest, deep valley and shola
thickly wooded, rushing streams and small cascades. Arrived at
Coonoor, 6,000 feet above sea level, the temperature becomes mild;
hedges chiefly composed of geraniums and roses; fruit trees, orchards,
and gardens, all in full bearing, meet the eye. In front of us a succession
of grass-covered “downs” appear, their general aspect completely
different from that presented by Himalayan sanatoria. In due time
“Ooty” is reached, but a severe attack of ague while riding up the
ghat rendered the latter part of the journey the reverse of pleasant.</p>

<p>In the immediate vicinity of this place, and scattered about among<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_216" id="Page_216">216</a></span>
the higher points of the hills, the aboriginal tribe of Todas have their
settlements, consisting of their peculiar-shaped huts, crowded together
as if for mutual defence. Of their original history, not a trace, not even
tradition remains; but other native hill races look upon them as the
original owners of the soil, and pay them in its produce, for the Todas
neither cultivate nor perform manual labour of any other kind, except
that certain members of each village community have the duties
assigned to them of milking their kine, and preparing their ghee, or
clarified butter. They practice <span class="locked">polyandry.<a name="FNanchor_258" id="FNanchor_258" href="#Footnote_258" class="fnanchor">258</a></span> Infanticide was frequent
among them until suppressed under the action of Government.</p>

<p>Very charming as a health resort was “the Southern Sanatorium”
found to be. Temperature moderate in degree and range, relatively
cooler than that of England in summer, warmer in winter, it possesses
greater advantages in these respects than corresponding places in the
Himalayan range. Thus, the mean shade temperature is&mdash;&#8203;in January,
53° F.; February, 56°; March, 62°; April, 63°; May, 62°; June, 60°;
July, 58°; August, 58°; September, 56°; October, 58°; November,
56°; December, 53°. Annual rainfall, 48 inches; rainy days, 19; with
occasional showers, 81; cloudy, 28; clear and fine, 238 = 365. In the
month of January, with a shade temperature of 53° F., that in the sun
was 118° F.</p>

<p>A visit to Bangalore presented several items of interest. One was
the peculiar method by which native workmen split off flakes of the
sienite rock that there abounds; the process comprising the application
of long-continued heat to the surface, after which the use of chisel,
hammer, and percussion so applied as to produce the effect desired. A
good deal of comment was the outcome of a visit paid to a “condemned”
barrack building, in which was accommodated the band of an
infantry regiment&mdash;&#8203;the walls of the edifice in so tumble-down a condition
that practice was prohibited lest the vibration caused by the
musical instruments should shake the remainder to pieces.</p>

<p>The old fort well repaid a visit to it. In 1791 it was captured by the
forces under Lord Cornwallis, the breaches then effected being still
traceable by the soft material with which they were filled up, while the
broad deep ditch around the fortress remains to a great extent in its
original condition. Among the dungeons in which Tippoo Sultan was
wont to imprison his captives that of Sir David Baird was indicated
to us; as also the wheel to which the captives were put for the double
purpose of raising water for palace use, and amusing thereby the ladies
of the zenana.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_217" id="Page_217">217</a></span>
With health unrestored, but rather deteriorated, duty had to be
resumed. An important item connected therewith was the inspection
of ships arriving with troops, or engaged for the conveyance of others
homewards, considerable exposure and fatigue necessarily undergone in
its performance. That risk to life was run in persisting to remain at my
post, instead of leaving India, was sufficiently clear to myself; but circumstances
determined me to run that risk.</p>

<p>Early in 1866 <span class="locked">duty<a name="FNanchor_259" id="FNanchor_259" href="#Footnote_259" class="fnanchor">259</a></span> took me to Benares. An excursion through
the narrow streets and to the shrines within that ancient city was
interesting, as a similar visit had been on a previous occasion. The
aspect of those streets, the style of dress of the people, their modes of
buying and selling, their religious observances, at the present day unchanged
since a date six centuries <span class="smcap smaller">B.C.</span>, when, as history records, Kasi
was a flourishing city. The temple of Bisheshwar, “the poison god”&mdash;&#8203;a
personification of Siva, the special deity of Benares, the object of
pilgrimage to thousands of Hindoos&mdash;&#8203;has within it the shrine in the
shape of a black stone, ever kept wet by Ganges water, before which
their special acts of devotion are performed. The minarets and
tapering summit of the temple still resplendent with gold gilding, with
which they were last decorated at the expense of Runjeet Singh, of
the Punjab. In close vicinity is the Gyan Kup, or “Well of Knowledge,”
in which Siva is believed by her worshippers to dwell, but
from which arises offensive odours from decomposing floral offerings.
In the “golden temple” itself is a figure representing the Kutwal, or
judicial officer of Bisheshwar, in his hand a club, at his feet two dogs of
stone&mdash;&#8203;Orion and Canes venatici.</p>

<p>Numerous other temples stand in the near vicinity of this the largest
and most important of all. Of these, one of small dimensions is sacred
to Sanichar, otherwise Saturn, the face of the deity being of a blue or
leaden hue. A second is dedicated to the goddess Anpoorna, of whom
it is related that when Benares was first established as a city, a famine
having occurred she supplied grain, Gunga, or the river Ganges, giving
water, and so the people were fed; the custom then established of giving
a daily allowance of grain and water being still continued, as witnesssed
by ourselves. A third temple visited was dedicated to the Sun.
Within it is a painting in which the great luminary is represented in a
chariot drawn by seven horses, clearly the prototype of Phœbus and
his car. A fourth, dedicated to Sukreshwar, or Venus, is much
frequented by women ambitious to become mothers of handsome sons.
To the courtesy and kindness of Dr. J. A. Dunbar, whose historical<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_218" id="Page_218">218</a></span>
knowledge of these and other places visited was great, I was indebted
for a most pleasant and interesting excursion.</p>

<p>Close to the river edge stood a temple to Sitala, goddess of small-pox,
the deity being a stone much worn; before it three female
devotees made poojah in hopes of thereby obtaining immunity against
or cure of the disease for themselves and relations&mdash;&#8203;a practice adopted
also and in like manner by the Chinese. Nangrah, or the temple of
the seven planets, after which are named the days of the week, was old
and dilapidated, not having been “restored” from the time of the
Mahomedan conquest, <span class="smcap smaller">A.D.</span> 1017, when, like many others, it was much
injured. A small, square-shaped tank, the Nand Kunka, is said to
be the point of junction between the Ganges, Jumna, and “sacred”
Suruswattee; but inasmuch as a similar union is assigned to Prague, <i>i.e.</i>
Allahabad, tradition seems to be at fault somewhere. Hindoos believe
that those who bathe in that Pool of Siloam at Benares attain immortality.
An object of different kind visited by us was the Man Mundee,
or old observatory erected by Rajah Jey Singh, <span class="smcap smaller">A.D.</span> 1693, at the same
time as that at Delhi, and, like it, now ruined. On the way to cantonments
is the house in which dwelt Warren Hastings, 1773&ndash;1781; at a
little distance that in which, in 1799, Mr. Davis repelled single-handed
the attack by followers of Wazir <span class="locked">Ali,<a name="FNanchor_260" id="FNanchor_260" href="#Footnote_260" class="fnanchor">260</a></span> after the latter had been deposed
from the throne of Oude by Sir John Shore, at that time Governor-General.</p>

<p>At a distance of a few miles, on a plain anciently known as the Deer
Park, are the ruins of Sarnath, a city said to date from the fourth
century <span class="smcap smaller">B.C.</span>, to have been the place where Sakya Muni first publicly
preached the doctrines of Buddhism, and to have been destroyed by
fire in the seventh century <span class="smcap smaller">A.D.</span> On a mound formed by ruins stood a
pillar like that of the Birs Nimroud. A second pillar had on it carvings
and scrolls peculiar to the Buddhists, whose style of architecture was
subsequently adopted by the Hindoos, to be reproduced in their
temples.</p>

<p>A sad and to me affecting visit was to the grave of my dear infant.
As I wrote at the time of his deplored death, so now, many years
thereafter, the impression of the loved child comes vividly upon <span class="locked">me.<a name="FNanchor_261" id="FNanchor_261" href="#Footnote_261" class="fnanchor">261</a></span></p>

<p>The Sanitary Commission already mentioned ceased to exist, and a
Commissioner appointed to take over the duties it had performed.
Great were the expectation of benefits to come, in respect to public
health and decrease of mortality which were to result from the labours<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_219" id="Page_219">219</a></span>
of our Commission; great also the individual confidence of members
in the realization of such hopes. In the literary inquiries connected
with my position on that Commission material was gathered for a work
on Army Hygiene, then published by me.</p>

<p>As the hot season advanced, my health, already much impaired,
suffered more severely than it had done while the heat of climate
remained somewhat moderate. Privilege leave was therefore applied,
and, after some delay, obtained. I accordingly made my way, for the
second time, to Madras and Ootacamund, accompanied by my dear
wife. Almost from the day of arrival my health improved; a series of
excursions, rides, and walks adding to beneficial influence of the
climate of that favourite place.</p>

<p>I had lately been appointed member of a Committee to examine and
report upon the relative medicinal values of the various alkaloids
obtained from cinchona. My attention thus drawn to the cultivation
of the plant or tree, I visited the extensive plantation which then
existed in the neighbouring hills, taking advantage to observe the
various methods of cultivation adopted with a view to increasing to the
utmost the deposit of quinine. But impressions were by no means
enthusiastic in regard to the probable pecuniary success of this
industry, or the permanent reliance of medical men upon its special
alkaloid, the use of which had already become considerably less than
it was a few years ago.</p>

<p>As the period of my leave drew to its close, and I began my return
journey, some of the experiences attending upon Indian travelling in
the hot season befell me. In the midst of storm and heavy rain,
at 2 a.m., I arrived at Coimbatore, then the railway terminus, got into
one of the carriages drawn up at the platform and there made myself
at home till 4.45 a.m., at which hour the train started. As the day
advanced, so did the strength of hot wind; the sky was lurid with
dust, while I, suffering severe pain, could neither recline nor sit
with anything approaching comfort. It was close upon midnight
when I reached the hotel at Madras, at which I had arranged to
alight.</p>

<p>With next morning came the newspapers of the day, containing the
very unwelcome intelligence that the Agra Bank had suspended payment.
Like many others in India, such small savings as I had been
able to effect were deposited in that concern; so now, my health
impaired, the rainy season before me, my wife left behind, my money
store for the time being in a precarious position, circumstances wore an
aspect by no means bright.</p>

<p>Returning to duty at Calcutta, the attention of public authorities<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_220" id="Page_220">220</a></span>
was found to be occupied by the condition of matters in India, and
that existing elsewhere, the latter having indirect relation to the
country itself. From several places on the coast line, more especially
Orissa, came sad reports of famine and of destructive pestilence, all
of which in due time extended to inland districts, even to the upper
provinces of Hindostan. To mitigate and relieve the suffering thus
occasioned, Sir John Lawrence initiated a variety of measures which
were destined in subsequent years to be systematized, and so meet the
occurrence of similar occurrences throughout the country. Beyond
our frontier, Sheer Ali, whose accession at Cabul had but lately been
recognised, was strengthening his position. Russia engaged in subjugating
Bokhara. In America there was talk about a Fenian invasion
of Canada, almost immediately followed by the collapse of such a plan,
if indeed it ever assumed shape. In Europe the unparalleled successes
of “the seven days’ war”; the surrender by Austria of Venetia to
Italy. Another event of importance was the laying of the Atlantic
Telegraph Cable, a scientific triumph in some respects more important
than the military occurrences just alluded to.</p>

<p>Early in the cold season, the arrival of the <i>Nile</i>, having on board
the Headquarters of the Buffs, gave me an opportunity of seeing once
again my first regiment with which, twenty-one years ago, I sailed from
the place where we now are for England. In the interval one or more
generations, in a regimental sense, had come and gone; so that to “my
first love” I was a stranger; officers and men unknown to me, I
unknown to them.</p>

<p>In pursuance of suggestions by the late Sanitary Commission, a
series of camp grounds were selected, to which in times of cholera
troops might conditionally be sent. At military stations, barracks were
to be erected in accordance with plans drawn out by the same body.
In these respects, impaired as health was, inspection of stations,
added to ordinary official routine, became an arduous duty.</p>

<p>Arrangements had to be made with reference to an expedition about
to be dispatched against the King of Abyssinia. In calculating the
probable requirements for which preparations had to be made, casualties
by climate were looked upon as likely to exceed those in battle;
supplies on a large scale were accordingly provided.</p>

<p>From bed to duty, from duty to bed: such in brief was the manner
in which were passed the three last months in Calcutta. In one
respect Fortune “smiled,”&mdash;&#8203;namely, that hospitality of a <span class="locked">friend<a name="FNanchor_262" id="FNanchor_262" href="#Footnote_262" class="fnanchor">262</a></span> supplied
all that need, or even luxury, required. The presence, moreover, of my<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_221" id="Page_221">221</a></span>
wife was a solace to me, though the condition of illness to which I was
reduced must have been the cause of much anxiety to her.</p>

<p>The first of the new transport ships to arrive was the <i>Jumna</i>. Being
sighted from Saugor at the end of September, a party of officials, of
which I was one, was speedily on board the river steamer <i>Koladyne</i>,
and away towards Diamond Harbour. The “trooper” soon loomed
high on the horizon, her general shape unusual, and being painted
white, her aspect differed from that of ships familiar to us. Coming to
anchor at the last-named place, the 7th Dragoon Guards and 2nd
Battalion Rifle Brigade were within a few days thereafter conveyed on
board, and away the ship steamed towards Suez.</p>

<p>At the end of October the second of the Indian transports, the
<i>Euphrates</i>, arrived at Calcutta, having on board the 2nd Battalion
60th Rifles, with which, six years ago, I had come down the Peiho
from Tientsin to Taku, when that battalion and myself were homeward
bound from China.</p>

<p>November was ushered in by the occurrence of a hurricane of
extreme violence, an example of the most severe of those meteors to
which this part of India is at intervals liable, the damage to shipping
and on shore being a counterpart of what has already been related
regarding another cyclone. On this occasion the <i>Euphrates</i> was
forced ashore at Diamond Harbour, where, during several hours, she
remained in a perilous position, but fortunately without damage, so
that as the storm abated she was restored to her anchorage. In due
course the ship arrived off Prinsep’s Ghat, the first of her kind to come
up the river so far. There the troops on board were landed, the hull
carefully examined by divers, and being declared to be uninjured, preparations
were made for the embarkation of the troops proceeding by
her to England.</p>

<p>The 27th, or Enniskillen Regiment, having embarked, I went on
board, together with my wife, on November 13. On the following day
enjoyed the often-talked-of, long-hoped-for gratification of viewing
Calcutta from over the stern of a homeward-bound vessel, at the same
time conscious of a protecting Providence to whom, under a series of
trying and otherwise unpleasant circumstances, my life had been so far
prolonged, and I enabled to meet the necessities of those dependent
upon me.</p>

<p>In due time we entered the remarkably beautiful harbour of
Trincomalee. Dotted with numerous islands, all thickly covered with
rich vegetation, the background filled up with a series of low forest-clad
hills, the general scene&mdash;&#8203;tropical in character&mdash;&#8203;could scarcely be
exceeded in loveliness. But the hot, damp atmosphere, as we landed<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_222" id="Page_222">222</a></span>
and drove through the town of the same name, was such that we experienced
no desire to prolong our stay.</p>

<p>Arrived at Aden, orders awaited the Commander to proceed at once
to Suez, which he accordingly did; but the circumstance caused a
good deal of excitement in the gallant Enniskillings, among whom the
wish was father to the belief that they were <i>sure</i> to be landed and sent
to Abyssinia.</p>

<p>Several vessels connected with the Abyssinian expedition were
anchored in the Gulf of Suez as the <i>Euphrates</i> entered it. The canal
across the isthmus had recently been begun, the troops arriving at
either end having still to be conveyed by rail and then re-embarked.
Here we speedily learned by telegraph that our corresponding transport
from Alexandria had met with a mishap so serious in kind
that delay of not less than three weeks was inevitable before we
could proceed.</p>

<p>Extensive docks were then in progress near to our anchorage. They
were formed from material raised from the sea-bed by dredgers and
other mechanical means; the masonry supplied from the neighbouring
Akaba range of hills. It was an unpleasant sight, as it was
suggestive, to see in the ooze so raised, considerable numbers of human
bones, confirming to some degree the evil repute assigned to Suez
boatmen, chiefly Greeks and Italians.</p>

<p>A considerable number of Egyptian troops were encamped on the
heights behind the city. The men, strong and active in appearance,
had, it was said, been slaves, captured by the Bedouins in the Soudan
and sold to agents of the Viceroy; they were dressed <i xml:lang="fr" lang="fr">à la Zouaves</i>, and
armed with swords and matchlocks.</p>

<p>A trip being organized for the purpose, we proceeded by boat drawn
by a couple of mules along the Freshwater canal; at the end of
about five miles arriving at Little Shaloof, where arrangements were in
progress so that by means of locks a junction between the two waterways
should take place. From there we proceeded as before, some
six miles more, to Grand Shaloof, where it was said the works in progress
could be best examined. At that place the depth of the channel
in course of excavation was 30 feet, the breadth 150. Crowds of workmen,
including French, Italian, Maltese, and Greeks, were employed
as navvies, the soil being carried up the sides by small rails, and
deposited on either side to form embankments. In the successive
layers of gravel, sand, and clay in which the workmen were engaged,
organic remains existed in considerable abundance; among them
oyster shells, encrinites, bones assigned to mastodon, and gigantic
teeth of the carcharodon. The canal is in working order from Port<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_223" id="Page_223">223</a></span>
Said to Ismaliah, where, in Lake Timsah, it is joined by the ancient
canal from Bulak.</p>

<p>At Shaloof a considerable village has sprung up in the midst of the
desert; the houses consist of wooden huts, the population being employés
on the canal. Around some of those huts little gardens had
been made, peas, beans, greens, asparagus, artichokes, jerusalem artichokes,
and spinach being among the vegetables grown in them; the
plants of larger growth within and surrounding them in the form of
incipient hedges included palma Christi, Eschynomene (or jait), thuja,
and willow.</p>

<p>The Freshwater Canal, by which we returned to Suez, had an average
depth of 5 to 6 feet, a breadth of 40 to 50. Its water, though originally
no doubt <i>sweet</i> and fresh, was now brackish, but on that account
not unsuited to the nourishment of particular kinds of plants, as along
its sides grew in abundance tamarisk, reed grass, rushes, and bulrushes.
A good deal of traffic was in progress along it; but otherwise the region
on either side was desert, destitute of man, house, or tree, the only
living things to be seen being a vulture in the distance, and in close
vicinity a drymoica or reed warbler of some kind. According to
history the portion of this canal which extends from Lake Timsah to
Bulak was made under <span class="locked">Sesostris;<a name="FNanchor_263" id="FNanchor_263" href="#Footnote_263" class="fnanchor">263</a></span> a continuation of it extended to
Suez,&mdash;&#8203;namely, that by which we travelled. The original channel has
several times fallen into decay, and been again repaired, the last occasion
on which it was so being under Mehemet Ali.</p>

<p>The population of Suez was said to comprise the scourings of all
nations. The place itself is not without points of historical interest.
It is considered to occupy the site, or very near the site, of Pihahiroth,
or simply Hira, Kolsim, and Arsinoe, the latter founded by Ptolemy
<span class="locked">Philadelphus.<a name="FNanchor_264" id="FNanchor_264" href="#Footnote_264" class="fnanchor">264</a></span> At a short distance from its north-east gate is a mound
on which stands a villa for the use of the Viceroy; at the base of that
mound is a thick layer of <span class="locked">asphalte,<a name="FNanchor_265" id="FNanchor_265" href="#Footnote_265" class="fnanchor">265</a></span> believed to indicate the site of
ancient baths. The modern town contains the house, now a telegraph
office, in which Napoleon the First once had his headquarters. Discretion
induced us, when visiting the town of evil repute, to go in sufficiently
large party to hold our own if necessary.</p>

<p>An excursion to Ayûn Musa, or Moses’ Wells, occupied pleasantly
an entire day. Proceeding by steam launch to Quarantine Harbour,
we there found mules and ponies, sent on the previous day. So
mounted, we scampered over the five or six miles of desert that<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_224" id="Page_224">224</a></span>
separated that place from the objects of our trip. As we neared the
wells, groves of date and other palms became more and more distinct;
the groves were seen to surround each of the twelve wells that form the
group, each moreover to be surrounded by walls, the garden so enclosed
well irrigated from its particular well, and yielding produce
abundantly. The largest well of the series is that to which tradition
assigns the halting-place of the Israelites on the third day of their
wandering in the wilderness of Etham after crossing “the Sea of
Reeds,” in the near vicinity of what is now Lake <span class="locked">Timsah.<a name="FNanchor_266" id="FNanchor_266" href="#Footnote_266" class="fnanchor">266</a></span> As then,
so at the present time, the water of Marah is “bitter,” otherwise
brackish and undrinkable, though used for purposes of irrigation; that
of the well in question gushed from the earth abundantly, bubbling as
it did so from several apertures. From it we went on to examine the
other springs that make up the group, on our way noting the style of
tree and under vegetation, and searching, as we did unsuccessfully,
for the “quails” (<i>Pterocles</i>, or sand-grouse) mentioned with reference
to the temporary halt at this place made by the Israelites; three hours
were so spent. On returning to the spring whence we had started, we
found it partly empty; it thus told its own story&mdash;&#8203;that it was tidal in
character. The surrounding gardens, amply irrigated as they were
from this well, yielded abundant crops of vegetables, including spinach,
radishes, chives, onions, and tomatoes. Among the trees within the
same enclosure were date, tamarisk, pomegranate, rose, fig, parkinsonia,
cirrus, lawsonia (the mendhee or hennah of India), myrtle, and mulberry.
Along the sides of the watercourses or irrigation channels a rich
green carpet of digitaria (or dhoop grass of India) grew. We saw no
such tree as had the property of rendering brackish water palatable to
the taste; not even the moringa aptera, the pods of which, when masticated,
are credited with that of rendering such water “sweet to the
palate.” On our return on board, we referred to <span class="locked">Josephus,<a name="FNanchor_267" id="FNanchor_267" href="#Footnote_267" class="fnanchor">267</a></span> and from
his account have no doubt that Moses recognised the wells which now
bear his name as in their nature tidal.</p>

<p>A very delightful excursion was that to Cairo, performed by rail
across the desert. From that most oriental city we drove to the Nile,
near to the island of Rodda; crossed the river by boat, passing close to
the Nilometer while we were in transit; landed at Ghizeh; mounted
donkeys; thence continued our journey over seven miles of road, consisting
of a dilapidated raised pathway through alluvial fields and
swamps dotted thickly with aquatic birds. Thus did we reach the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_225" id="Page_225">225</a></span>
famous and very remarkable Pyramids of Ghizeh. The largest of these,
namely, that of Cheops&mdash;&#8203;<span class="smcap smaller">B.C.</span> 2400 about&mdash;&#8203;was the special object of
our excursion. In ascending one of its sides we had the aid of powerful
Arabs, whose demonstrative methods of assistance were by no
means appreciated by the ladies of our party. The massive stones that
formed the stair-like ascent of this most ancient monument in the world
had a thickness ranging from two to three feet; they consisted of two
kinds, the one set of nummulite, the other of chalky clay, but the
coating and outer layer that in ancient times completely covered them
has long ceased to exist. The summit is flat; the view from it extensive:
it includes Cairo, the Libyan hills, pyramids of Sakkara and of
Dashur, the position of “the Battle of the Pyramids,” the two smaller
pyramids of Cephrenes and Mycerenes respectively, the Sphynx, and
numerous tombs. On our left were the pits in which it is believed the
mortar for the larger pyramid was mixed; the small mud pyramid,
supposed to be that of Cheops’ daughter; then in the distance heaps
composed of materials raised from pillaged tombs.</p>

<p>The descent proved more difficult than the ascent. After a short
rest we proceeded to explore the interior of the huge pile. From the
entrance we descended, by a narrow passage not more than four feet in
height, a distance of 106 feet, then ascended by another passage, at an
angle of 27°, to “the Queen’s Chamber.” Returning to the point from
which branches upward the great gallery, we ascended by it to “the
King’s Chamber,” passing in our progress through the supposed position
of four ancient portcullises. Returning to, and glad to be in, the
open air, we passed on to Campbell’s <span class="locked">Tomb,<a name="FNanchor_268" id="FNanchor_268" href="#Footnote_268" class="fnanchor">268</a></span> in which, at a depth of
sixty feet from the surface, lies exposed the sarcophagus of porphyry
described in books of travel. Thence to the Sphynx, now mutilated,
yet whose intensely grave, placid expression struck us with awe, as it
has affected other travellers who have visited it during the thousands
of years included in its history.</p>

<p>Near the Sphynx is a temple excavated in the solid rock. Huge
blocks, some seventeen feet long, of red granite are in it so arranged as
to form passages and doorways; others of alabaster, of scarcely smaller
dimensions, being interspersed among them. So far, information is
wanting with regard to the history of this temple; but to us it is no less
wonderful in its way than any of the other objects and buildings we
visited.</p>

<p>At last the time came for the troops on board the <i>Euphrates</i> to
resume their homeward voyage. It was with regret that we took leave
of Captain Dunn and officers, and proceeded to the train by which the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_226" id="Page_226">226</a></span>
transit across the desert was to be made. It was now late in December;
the <i>sensation</i> of cold experienced by us during the night of our
journey very severe, far beyond what readings of the thermometer
indicated.</p>

<p>By afternoon of 28th we were on board the <i>Crocodile</i>, and away from
Alexandria. On New Year’s Day anchored in the Grand Harbour of
Malta, in which as companions our transport had British ironclads, and
vessels of all sorts belonging to various nationalities. Resuming our
voyage on the 3rd, we passed Gibraltar on the 6th; thence homeward
the passage was short but boisterous. On the 12th we landed at Portsmouth,
our leave-taking very different in kind from that on quitting the
<i>Euphrates</i>.</p>

<p class="drop-cap5"><span class="smcap1">Appointed</span> to the Southern <span class="locked">District,<a name="FNanchor_269" id="FNanchor_269" href="#Footnote_269" class="fnanchor">269</a></span> the duties connected with
departmental administration were entered upon without delay.
Within the garrison of Portsmouth, headquarters of the district, they
included work relating to embarking and disembarking troops, in addition
to ordinary routine; through the district, inspections of military
establishments and places with which I was already familiar.</p>

<p>In visiting establishments on the Isle of Wight some pleasant excursions
were taken in company with a kindred <span class="locked">spirit<a name="FNanchor_270" id="FNanchor_270" href="#Footnote_270" class="fnanchor">270</a></span> in regard to natural
things. With geological map in <span class="locked">hand,<a name="FNanchor_271" id="FNanchor_271" href="#Footnote_271" class="fnanchor">271</a></span> we walked from point to point
comparing the strata as we proceeded with the several illustrative
sketches there presented. So also official visits to the Isle of Portland
gave opportunity of studying the history presented by its rocks and
strata, with regard to its alternating elevations and submergences in
geological periods. The operations in progress at Spithead in connection
with forts intended to be built there supplied with ample material
in different shapes those among us whose tastes led us to take interest
in them.</p>

<p>Among our numbers were several men devoted to different branches
of natural history; others whose tastes and pursuits were in more
purely professional subjects. By means of a happy combination
between the two a <span class="locked">society<a name="FNanchor_272" id="FNanchor_272" href="#Footnote_272" class="fnanchor">272</a></span> was set on foot, a room with fuel and light
assigned to its use by the War Office, and an excellent library collected.
Papers were read at its meetings, abstracts being published in the
London professional journals. So great was the success which attended<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_228" id="Page_228">228</a></span>
our efforts that a society of allied kind was established by scientific
and professional residents of Portsmouth and its vicinity.</p>

<p>The then governor of Portland convict prison had previously held a
similar position at Norfolk Island, to which at that time the worst and
most desperate criminals were sent from New South Wales. The men
he had there to deal with were the most desperate and reckless of their
class; but some of the accounts Mr. Clifton gave regarding his method
towards them were most interesting, some even pathetic, the keynote
of his system having been, on suitable occasions, to appeal to their
human nature. With evident gusto we were invited to enter what
he called his museum of implements with which from time to time
attempts on his life had been made by convicts under his charge; and
very miscellaneous were they as they lay upon their shelves, duly labelled
and arranged. Among the convicts were some who had in their day
occupied high social position, one of them in particular. Passing them
as we did, our gaze was averted as we did so, but it was not in us to
withhold from them a thought of pity.</p>

<p>At Parkhurst the “governor” of the convict prison was a lady, the
convicts being women. It was the boast of Mrs. Gibson that, in maintaining
discipline and administering justice for offences, no barrier of
any kind separated her from the offender brought before her, and yet,
unlike the experience already mentioned, with the exception of one
occasion, violence had never been offered her. “Unless,” said she, “I
have sufficient moral power to maintain order, my influence would be
gone.” Her daughter had been carefully tended from infancy to womanhood
by a life convict. But among her prisoners were some whose
disposition was most desperate; there were others who, when they “felt
a fit of passion coming on,” made request to their “governor” that, as
a favour, she would allow them to “go to the pump,” so that by the
violent exertion there required of them they might “work it off.” A
short time previous there had been under her charge as life convict a
young lady, the story of whose “crime” and conviction occupied
public attention to a more than usual degree, the question of her guilt
being no less discussed than were the circumstances under which her
confession had been obtained, the reality of that confession, and the
relation of “confessors” to the individual on the one hand, and to law
on the other.</p>

<p>The periodical inspection of Garrison prisoners came within the
ordinary routine of duty. As a matter of information, inquiries on such
occasions were directed to the effect, if any, of punishments undergone
by soldiers in deterring them from subsequent crime, the usual reply received
being that “the same men come here over and over again.” Past<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_229" id="Page_229">229</a></span>
experience in regiments had been to the same effect in regard to offences,
and to a considerable extent also to men coming “on the sick report”
to hospital, the numbers of the latter depending greatly upon the kind
of duty, parades, drills, and so on, that was about to take place. Regimental
surgeons understood all such moves on the part of the men,
and for the most part were able to estimate at its approximate value the
statements made by individuals.</p>

<p>While visiting a military gymnasium, attention was drawn to performances
by the non-commissioned officer in charge, a noted gymnast,
some of whose feats on the trapeze and otherwise were remarkable as
showing high proficiency in his art. At the time of their performance
his appearance indicated advanced phthisis, and within a month thereafter
he succumbed to that condition. Other instances more or less
similar to his have come under notice, indicating that the ability to
perform feats of “strength” and agility is not a constant indication of
robust health, although it may be of “knack” acquired by practice.</p>

<p>Duty brought me in contact from time to time with regiments with
which on previous occasions I had been associated; for example, the
34th at Azimghur, 35th at Dinapore, 97th at Sooltanpore, and 67th at
Tientsin. The arrival of the 33rd from Abyssinia was made an occasion
to do honour to the gallant “West Ridings” for its services in
that campaign. That of the 101st on its first tour of home service was
attended by various incidents, some amusing in their way, showing how
new to the men were the conditions in which they found themselves.
Fortunately for them “comrades” in garrison gave them willing help
in landing baggage, carrying coals, filling straw beds, and so on.</p>

<p>Visiting the barracks at Chichester, I learned some particulars with
reference to the sequel of the incident connected with a soldier of the
3rd Light Dragoons at Wuzzeerabad in 1853. That regiment now
occupied those barracks preparatory to going on foreign service, but so
numerous had been the changes during the interval that with difficulty
was one man found who remembered it. According to his account the
particulars given by the man then alluded to, in regard to his part in
the murder on Wandsworth Common, the disposal of watch and chain
of his victim, were confirmed by subsequent inquiries. The man himself
was condemned to a lunatic asylum, and there he died.</p>

<p>While walking along High Street on one occasion, attention was
attracted to two medals exposed for sale in the window of a well-known
silversmith of that day. To them was attached a short printed notice
relating that they were the identical decorations presented to the two
men most distinguished for gallantry in the battle of Waterloo. In
default of heirs they had come to be among the contents of an old<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_230" id="Page_230">230</a></span>
curiosity shop. They had respectively been bestowed upon Colonel
Macdonell and Sergeant Graham, both of the Coldstream Guards, for
their defence of Hougomont against the combined forces under Jerome
Bonaparte, Foy, and Bachelu. On subsequent occasions, orders and
decorations for the Mutiny campaign were, for lack of heirs, sold by
public auction; a commentary on the passing value of such things,
highly prized though they are by those on whom, for services rendered,
they were conferred in the first instance.</p>

<p>In the spring of 1870 I experienced in person what in many other
instances is a sequence of continued attacks of malarious illness, in
that they seemed to culminate in one of great severity, even after nearly
a year and a half of English climate. To the great care and skill of
two army <span class="locked">surgeons<a name="FNanchor_273" id="FNanchor_273" href="#Footnote_273" class="fnanchor">273</a></span> I owe my recovery&mdash;&#8203;indeed, my life.</p>

<p>Restoration to full activity was slow. Meantime, a duty devolved
upon me the nature of which was unpleasant, as it seemed to me
invidious. A scheme of Army retrenchment was to be enforced. In
accordance therewith reductions in the numbers of men borne on their
rolls were ordered to be carried out in regiments in our particular
district as in others; the instructions under which officers concerned
were obliged to act leaving to them little, if any, discretionary power.</p>

<p>The classes of men to be selected for discharge, and so make room
for recruits to be enlisted under the short service system, comprised&mdash;&#8203;(1)
the sickly and weak; (2) those of bad character; (3) those who for
reasons of their own were desirous of obtaining discharge. It was felt
that, of the first, the greater number would be cast adrift, incapable of
earning a livelihood, and so be thrown upon parish relief; that by the
second, a number of incorrigible characters would be let loose on the
public, to prey upon it either by begging or by crime, to be further a
burthen to the taxpayer in respect to expenses of prosecution, and
of maintenance in prison while undergoing punishment for crimes committed.
The third class was composed of those who, having become
trained soldiers, inured to discipline, were lost to the service when
their individual value was at its greatest. Some of us felt strongly then
that such numerical reductions as were deemed necessary, on account
of public reasons, might have been carried out by the more gradual and
less objectionable method of ceasing to recruit for a few weeks or
months.</p>

<p class="drop-cap3"><span class="smcap1">In</span> the middle of July (1870) the morning papers recorded the incident
at Ems, soon to become famous, between Benedetti and the
King of Prussia, its effect in Paris a demand for war, and by the populace
shouts of “<i xml:lang="fr" lang="fr">À Berlin!</i>” Events rapidly developed; the Powers
concerned prepared for war; proffered mediation by England rejected
by France. On the 21st of that month war was declared by the King
of Prussia; on the 23rd by the Emperor of the French; on August 2
the young Prince Imperial received his <i xml:lang="fr" lang="fr">baptême de feu</i>;<a name="FNanchor_274" id="FNanchor_274" href="#Footnote_274" class="fnanchor">274</a> war had
begun.</p>

<p>A few days thereafter I was warned for service with the French in the
capacity of Medical Commissioner, to report to the War Office on certain
specified points relating to military organization in the field.
Aware of the importance of duties before me, preparations were quickly
made for entering upon them, including the payment of heavy extra
premium to an insurance office.</p>

<p>From that time onwards my attention was directed to the remarkable
development of military events by which those declarations were followed.
In the first instance there was the small success of the French
at Saarbruck on August 2, followed on the 4th by their severe defeat
at Weissenburg, after which one defeat after another followed in quick
succession; namely, Woerth and Spicheren on the 6th; Forbachen on<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_232" id="Page_232">232</a></span>
the 7th; St. Avold on the 9th, when the partial investment of Metz
began; Strasburg invested on the 10th; the battle of Courcelles or
Longville, near Penge, on the 14th; the battles of Mars la Tour, Gravelotte,
and St. Privat, 16th to 18th, both inclusive, leading to the complete
investment of Metz. The aspect of affairs had been so affected
by those events that preparations for the defence of Paris began on the
23rd. The Germans following up their victories by that of Beaumont,
near the Belgian frontier, on the 30th, forced MacMahon to fall back
upon Sedan, after sustaining very severe losses in men, guns, and stores.
In other directions, during the same period, one success after another
continued to attend the advance of the invaders.</p>

<p>The 1st of September was with me a busy day; among its incidents,
receiving instructions from the War Office, special passport from
the Foreign Office, letter of credit and necessary cash from agents, and
lastly, taking leave of my beloved wife. Leaving Charing Cross by the
8.45 p.m. train, I arrived in Paris early the following morning. Later
in the day, in obedience to orders, I reported my arrival to the British
Embassy, presenting at the same time my official credentials. I was
informed that an application would be made to the Ministry of War
for a <i xml:lang="fr" lang="fr">sauf conduit</i>, to enable me to proceed and join the “Army of
the Rhine” under Marshal MacMahon, at that time “somewhere
between Verdun and Mezières, on the left side of the Meuse.”</p>

<p>An impression was “in the air” that all was not well with that army,
but beyond rumours more or less vague nothing seemed to indicate
knowledge of actual events of the previous day, still in progress at, and
in the vicinity of Sedan. Afternoon and evening brought more definite
particulars; telegrams from Mezières announced that MacMahon was
wounded, fugitives inundating that town, all communication with Sedan
“interrupted”; but to inquiries made in official quarters there was
silence.</p>

<p>We had observed that near the Gare du Nord large numbers of workmen
were engaged on the fortifications in that direction. Within the
walls bodies of armed men, some in uniform, many not, marched along
the thoroughfares or were undergoing drill. As day advanced crowds
assembled at corners; pedestrians increased in number; kiosks and
windows presented caricatures, in execrable taste, of Prussians from
king to peasant. The Champs Elysées was comparatively deserted;
already it had an unkept appearance. Here and there a small group
gazed at the performances of Punchinello; a few equipages drove along
its centre way. Agencies of various Sociétés des Secours aux Blessés
had taken up positions in large buildings or open spaces; from many
windows and over entrances floated Red Cross flags.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_233" id="Page_233">233</a></span>
At an early hour on the 3rd, Colonel Claremont, Military Secretary
to the British Embassy, conducted me to the several offices, from one
or other of which he expected that the necessary orders would be
issued to enable me to carry out the mission assigned to me. Failing
to obtain those orders at one and all so visited, he made direct
application to the Minister for War, but with no other result than an
intimation that “the correspondence on the subject must pass through
the ordinary routine, and in the meantime I must wait.” It was evident
that something very unusual had taken place or was in progress;
the demeanour of the officials with whom we came in contact indicated
the fact with sufficient clearness. Colonel Claremont was in all probability
made acquainted with the nature of the events in question, for as
we separated, each to proceed his own way, his parting remark was,
“I don’t expect now that you will go much beyond Paris.”</p>

<p>The Champ de Mars forms a huge camp ground; <i xml:lang="fr" lang="fr">tentes abri</i>,
guns, waggons, tumbrils, horses, and men crowd the space so named.
Infantry of the line there are in battalions, many of them undergoing
the earlier stages of military drill, their style and general aspect far
from realizing the British idea of what is soldier-like. The arrangement
of the camp itself, including tents, <i xml:lang="fr" lang="fr">matériel</i>, conveniences and necessities,
slovenly and untidy.</p>

<p>In its immediate vicinity the Seine was a washtub for the troops,
many of whom were occupied in beating, scrubbing, and otherwise
cleansing articles of their clothing in the edge of the stream. I lean
over the parapet and observe the process. I am grasped by a <span class="locked">soldier;<a name="FNanchor_275" id="FNanchor_275" href="#Footnote_275" class="fnanchor">275</a></span>
others hurry to his aid; I am captured, a prisoner. The spy mania is
rampant. I am marched off as such, first to one “post,” then to
another; passport and other official documents taken from me; my
escort increasing as we proceeded. It comprises cavalry, infantry, and
gamins, the latter becoming more and more “demonstrative” in their behaviour
as we went, now shouting, “<i xml:lang="fr" lang="fr">À bas le Prussien!</i>” “<i xml:lang="fr" lang="fr">À bas Bismarck!</i>”
now laying hands roughly upon me, until it looks as if in their excitement
things might fare badly with me. Arrived at a police station in
the Rue Grenelle, I found myself deposited in the company of a very
miscellaneous assortment of prisonniers, and there spent some two or
three hours as best I could. At the end of that time my credentials
were flung at, rather than given back to me; the official of the place
pointed to the door, and without deigning a look at me said, “<i xml:lang="fr" lang="fr">Voilà!
Allez</i>,” and so we parted. Naturally enough I was indignant, and on
reaching my hotel declared my intention to report to our Representative<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_234" id="Page_234">234</a></span>
the episode through which I had passed; but was quietly informed
by others better acquainted than I then was with the state of affairs,
that I need not trouble myself; he would do nothing in the matter.</p>

<p>As evening wore on, rumours of the morning assumed the aspect
of facts, terrible in their nature as they were unlooked for and unexpected:
the French had been hopelessly defeated at Sedan; MacMahon
wounded and a prisoner; the Emperor a prisoner; 40,000 <span class="locked">men<a name="FNanchor_276" id="FNanchor_276" href="#Footnote_276" class="fnanchor">276</a></span> of
his army prisoners; no obstacle to delay, far less prevent, the advance
of the Prussians upon Paris. All was excitement along the
streets and boulevards; shouts were heard of “<i xml:lang="fr" lang="fr">Déchéance!</i>” and “<i xml:lang="fr" lang="fr">Vive
la République!</i>” Doubts and fears were expressed as to what on the
morrow the fate of the Empress, who was still in the Tuileries, might
possibly be.</p>

<p>All through the following night there were sounds of movement
in the streets: the tread of troops on the march, the heavy roll of
guns, tumbrils, and waggons. In the Chamber of Deputies transactions
were in progress the nature of which did not transpire till long afterwards,
though the results were to be seen within the space of a few
hours. Men, who till then had been ministers and other officials of
the Emperor, declared shortly after midnight the Imperial regime
had <span class="locked">ceased;<a name="FNanchor_277" id="FNanchor_277" href="#Footnote_277" class="fnanchor">277</a></span> they elected from among themselves what was intended
to be a “Governing Commission,” and so discounted the events of the
morrow. No wonder that such a self-chosen body failed to receive
general acceptance, as indeed was scarcely to be looked for considering
the many discordant political elements existing within the capital.</p>

<p>From early morning of Sunday, the 4th, a dense and tumultuous
crowd filled the Place de la Concorde; in the Rue Royale and Faubourg
St. Honoré workmen were hauling down Imperial eagles and
“N’s,” by which various public buildings were distinguished and ornamented,
the mob cheering them as they proceeded with their self-imposed
work. The gates of the Tuileries gardens were open, the
gardens of the palace filled with people; down the Rue de Rivoli, and
upwards towards the Arc de Triomphe, the Champs Elysées, streams of
people were in motion. Across the entrance to the bridge leading to
the palace of the Corps Législatif, a body of regular troops was drawn
up with bayonets fixed. Down along the Champs Elysées marched in
cadence to beat of drum and note of bugle an imposing force of
National Guards. Nearer and nearer they came; greater and greater
was the excitement in the crowd, including the small body of foreigners<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_235" id="Page_235">235</a></span>
who, like myself, were irresistibly drawn to, and by curiosity held in the
scene. A moment more and the two sets of forces must have been
in actual collision with each other&mdash;&#8203;with what consequences who could
predict? Then were raised upon bayonet points the képis of the
regulars, as from their ranks the shout burst forth, “<i>Vive la Garde
Nationale!</i>” The latter instantly followed suit; the shout of “<i xml:lang="fr" lang="fr">Vive la
Ligne!</i>” told us that fraternization was complete. The hall of the Legislature
was immediately occupied by the bourgeois; half an hour later
the Government of the Defence was proclaimed in the Hôtel de Ville.
Armed men in blouses took the place of sentries of the Guard at the
Tuileries; the tricolour still waved above the central dome of the palace.
The sympathy of us foreigners who mingled in the crowd was with the
Empress, as we expressed to each other in subdued tones, our wonder
as to the means by which her escape would be effected, or whether she
was to fall into the hands of the masses, now wild with excitement as
they yelled out “<i xml:lang="fr" lang="fr">Déchéance!</i>” “<i xml:lang="fr" lang="fr">Vive la Nation!</i>” “<i xml:lang="fr" lang="fr">Vive la République!</i>”
interspersed with still more threatening ejaculations. That a Revolution
had taken place, the Empire given place to the Republic, was evident;
the apparent ease with which that great change had been effected was
matter of surprise to onlookers, and to the people by whom it was
effected. In the Place de la Concorde the sergeants de ville were
roughly handled, old scores paid off, in some few instances their
lives taken; the statues of Strasbourg and other cities were draped in
crimson cloth; then came along the quays bodies of infantry, cavalry,
and artillery, not to open fire upon the revolutionary crowds, but in
progress to the outskirts of the city.</p>

<p>Long after the occurrence of the events just related, the circumstance
transpired that arrangements had in anticipation been made to ensure
the safety of the Empress. The passages of the palace and inner gates
were occupied and otherwise protected by a considerable force of the
Imperial Guard, so that as in their haste the crowd rushed in from the
direction of the Place de la Concorde, they were moved on and on
until they emerged from the palace into the Cour de Carrousel, where,
finding themselves so far outmanœuvred, they stood irresolute. It was
then that, taking advantage of their confusion, the escape of the
Empress was effected by the aid of Prince Metternich and Madame La
Breton Bourbaki; whether with that of M. F. de Lesseps or not seems
to be questioned.</p>

<p>Vinoy at the head of the 13th Army Corps arrives from Mezières,
his retreat therefrom, in face of the Germans flushed by victory at
Sedan, looked upon as the most masterly performance yet achieved.
His forces occupy camp in the Avenue de la Grande Armée, and<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_236" id="Page_236">236</a></span>
thither crowds resort to see the men who had performed so successful a
feat; the order and regularity in all that concerns them indicating their
training and discipline in strong contrast to what was so recently experienced
in the Champ de Mars. But chiefly was attention directed
to certain mysterious objects carefully concealed by canvas coverings,
but with an outline like that of artillery guns. These were <i xml:lang="fr" lang="fr">mitrailleuses</i>,
from which great results were anticipated.</p>

<p>To walls of houses and enclosures were affixed announcements
that the Republic had been declared, and giving the names of those
who now constituted the Provisional Government. Other notices
similarly displayed contained appeals to patriotism on the part of the
National Guards, and manhood of the capital, that they should rally to
the rescue of <i xml:lang="fr" lang="fr">La Patrie en Danger</i>. Troops of the line marched in
various directions, the object of the movements not apparent. Groups
of men stood at intervals along the streets, the <i>képi</i> as yet the only
item of uniform worn by them.</p>

<p>The tone of the press moderated from what had lately been; it was
evident that grave events threatened, the possible nature of which
caused thinking people some anxiety. Cafés usually brilliantly
lighted and crowded with customers became less so; uniforms took
the place of civilian costume at the small tables within and without.
Outside the ramparts, houses and other buildings were in course of
demolition. On the defences the work of repair and strengthening was
in progress. Railway stations were crowded by people,&mdash;&#8203;some endeavouring
to get away, together with their removable belongings;
others to get all such property inside for comparative safety.</p>

<p>Preparations for defence went on apace. Private carriages disappeared,
except such as were retained by special permission; public conveyances
decreased in number, the horses belonging to them being
requisitioned for public purposes. Women pedestrians were few;
scarcely a man to be seen on the streets, in shops, offices, and other
establishments, but those who wore more or less complete uniform;
those on the streets carrying rifles, side arms, or both. At night, and
throughout the day, the sound of drum and bugle was incessant;
here and there varied by the Marseillaise sung in stentorian voice.
In the Place de la Concorde successive bodies of armed men paid
homage before the statue of Strasbourg, gesticulating and vociferating
as they did so, that emblem becoming concealed under the wreaths
deposited upon it. Meanwhile, to prevent the Prussians from obtaining
the game hitherto preserved for Imperial purposes, a public battue
to take place at Compiêgne was proclaimed.</p>

<p>Men, to whom in the emergency arms were issued, increased<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_237" id="Page_237">237</a></span>
numerically faster than did the means of providing them with uniform.
Already did the circumstance suggest itself to many that by placing in
the hands of the masses such means of offence, a source of possible
danger to public safety was thereby created. That idea was speedily
fostered by the occurrence of scenes of disorder in some localities
by the men so armed; by others no less suggestive, in which men
“fraternized” with troops of the line over absinthe in cabarets.</p>

<p>By the 10th of the month the Prussian forces, 300,000 strong, were
at Ligny, not more than twenty-five miles from the capital. The
terms in which by certain journals appeals were made to the invaders
were questionable in respect to dignity: on the one hand, if as
“friends,” offering friendship; on the other, if as enemies, barricades
and sewers transformed into mines to be exploded under them. M.
Balbi proposed that <i>portable</i> fortresses, each of a strength equal to one
hundred thousand men, should be sent against them; other proposals
for annihilation of the advancing armies were submitted to the
authorities, and declared impracticable.</p>

<p>During next few days information as to transactions was received
with increasing vagueness, such items as seemed reliable only through
English papers, and that not for long. Some of the classes, who in
more peaceful times had willingly served in the ranks when “drawn,”
now expressed a desire to serve by substitute, if they could. Mobiles
in great number arrived in Paris from the provinces. Public announcements
declared that so great was the devotion of the people to
the Defence that the <i xml:lang="fr" lang="fr">Levée en Masse</i> would leave the proportion of men
at their homes as one to twenty-eight women. According to some published
statements, the men already enrolled were more formidable in
numbers than in quality; the withdrawals from the city of those liable
to service so numerous that special measures against them were proposed
in respect to their civil rights and property. A report circulated
to the effect that cartridges and other ammunition contained in
ordnance stores had been seriously tampered with.</p>

<p>It is Sunday. Fashionable resorts, including the Champs Elysées
and Gardens of the Tuileries, are crowded with men and women.
Cafés partially deserted a few days ago are now crowded. Booths
of Punchinello are surrounded by knot of amused spectators, the
style and demeanour of the people generally by no means such as
might be looked for under the circumstances present and prospective.
Mobiles recently collected from the provinces rush about irregularly
wherever the crowds are thickest; their rifles at the “trail”; their
bayonets fixed,&mdash;&#8203;sources of danger to everybody. Streets and roadways
show signs of neglect. News circulates that the Canal de l’Ourque<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_238" id="Page_238">238</a></span>
and some other conduits have been “cut” by the Germans, the fact
being the first to indicate the near approach of the enemy.</p>

<p>“Versailles has honourably capitulated.” Such was the next intelligence
to reach us. Confusion thereupon became general. A grand
review of forces of the Defence of Paris forthwith ordered; information
circulated by authority that the several forts beyond the line of
ramparts were fully armed and manned by sailors under command of
their own proper officers. As extemporised battalions marched towards
the general rendezvous they presented in their ranks two types of manhood&mdash;&#8203;the
Parisian and the provincial: the former poor in physique,
and undisciplined; the latter, strong and active, but unacquainted with
anything beyond elementary stages of military drill. A captive balloon
established on Montmartre from which to observe the movements of
the enemy. A furore of destruction suddenly set in, resulting in that
of bridges, houses, and everything destructible on the immediate outskirts
of the city, including a considerable strip of the Bois de
Boulogne.</p>

<p>Stores and provisions were collected to enable Paris to withstand a
siege of two months’ duration, that being thought the limit to which
such an emergency could extend, should it happen at all. Cattle and
stock of all kinds were brought within the walls; fodder and grain for
them collected, and food of all kinds, available for human consumption,
stored; a census of “mouths” taken at the same time.</p>

<p>Already had evils shown themselves as a result of billeting armed
men on the people; huts were therefore prepared in the boulevards
and other open spaces for the former. Disinclination was soon apparent
in a suggestively large number of the men to occupy their proper
places on parade. From the city there was reported exodus of men
whose names were enrolled for military service. On the walls were
posted codes of instructions as to the correct manner of loading rifles.
Authority was given to the system now introduced whereby improvised
battalions of National Guards elected their own officers&mdash;&#8203;a system from
which deplorable results were soon to arise.</p>

<p>Gates along the line of fortifications were now closed against traffic,
except to persons bearing special permits. Musters taken of so-called
“effective” combatants, prepared, according to declarations by themselves,
to defend the capital to the death, gave their number, including
all <span class="locked">classes<a name="FNanchor_278" id="FNanchor_278" href="#Footnote_278" class="fnanchor">278</a></span> of troops, approximately at 400,000. Among us foreigners<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_239" id="Page_239">239</a></span>
hints circulated that neither by Trochu nor other superior officer were
hopes of ultimate success entertained, taking into account the kind of
material so extemporised. M. Thiers had proceeded on his mission to
the Governments of Europe; hopes accordingly entertained that intervention
by England, Russia, and Austria, singly or united, might be
brought about. It was an open secret that sympathy of the principal
leaders, civil and military, within the capital were more in favour of the
past regime than of that now entered upon, their hopes that by some
means or other restoration might be effected, a siege and probable
bombardment averted. Those hopes were soon destroyed; information
circulated that the terms on which further proceedings on the part
of the Germans could be arrested, included such items as a heavy
money <span class="locked">indemnity,<a name="FNanchor_279" id="FNanchor_279" href="#Footnote_279" class="fnanchor">279</a></span> the retrocession of Alsace and Lorraine, as also
of half the French fleet.</p>

<p>In the streets and everywhere else within the city filth and otherwise
objectionable matters had accumulated to a very unpleasant degree;
means of conservancy and cleansing were deficient; the atmosphere
polluted by odours of decomposition. A separate police force to take
the place of the Gens d’Armes extinguished on the day of Revolution
had not yet been established; crimes of violence were the more remarkable
in their infrequency when that circumstance is taken into
account, together with the heterogeneous elements of which the defensive
forces were now composed.</p>

<p>The plot thickens; information reaches us which leaves no doubt
but that Paris is encircled by the enemy. Within the city there is
general commotion; in battalions and smaller bodies newly raised
levies march towards Vincennes; trains of ambulance carriages wend
their way in the same direction. Official notices affixed to walls
direct that all men liable to military service should report themselves
within twenty-four hours at the rendezvous of their respective corps,
under penalty of being proceeded against as deserters. In striking
contrast to all this turmoil was the sight of several elderly men and
others calmly and peacefully fishing in the Seine; their prize an occasional
gudgeon two inches long or thereabout!</p>

<p>At this point some representatives of Great Powers quitted the
beleaguered city with the intention of proceeding to Tours, where it was
stated another Government than that of the capital was in process of<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_240" id="Page_240">240</a></span>
formation. Among those who did so was the British Ambassador. The
Consul of Paris had already proceeded on leave of absence, the outcome
of the state of affairs so created being that upwards of two
thousand persons claiming the rights and privileges of British subjects
were left without official representative. Colonel Claremont, Military
Secretary, to his great credit, speedily returned within the ramparts,
and remained with the besieged until the defeat at Champigny left the
question of capitulation a matter of only a few weeks to be decided.
By no means did all the Foreign Representatives quit the capital.
Among those who remained were the Minister and Consul-General of
the United States; the Ministers of Belgium, Spain, Portugal, Switzerland,
Denmark, Sweden, and Norway. Neither did the Persian Ambassador
withdraw from his official position in Paris.</p>

<p>The corps of Sergeants de Ville is re-introduced; itinerant musicians
parade the streets, their favourite instruments the barrel-organ, harp,
and violin; beggars become numerous and demonstrative. Parties of
Mobiles march excitedly, and in an irregular manner, in various directions,
no one knowing the why or wherefore of their movements; some
to the sound of drum and bugle, others without such instruments. A
report circulates that outside the ramparts the members of that force
fired upon each other instead of <i>at</i> the enemy; they were said to have
arrested their commander on the plea that he held communication with
the Prussians. A tax was put upon meat and bread sold in shops;
supplies from without had all but ceased; Rentes were down to 54.15.
The general demeanour of the masses in ill accord with the conditions
in which their capital now was.</p>

<p>From the day on which intelligence of the great defeat at Sedan
reached Paris, a degree of enthusiasm became manifest among official
classes and private individuals, in regard to arrangements for possible
sick and wounded, which contrasted very favourably with the confusion
and indecision in military affairs already recorded. The ordinary military
hospitals under administration of the Intendance were equipped
to their utmost extent; various large buildings fitted up as <i>annexes</i>
thereto; societies of various kinds, and pertaining to different nationalities,
established hospitals, or <i xml:lang="fr" lang="fr">ambulances sedentaires</i> as such places
came to be called, at different points throughout the city; several clubs
were similarly transformed, and numerous private families made what
arrangements they could for the reception of sick or wounded men in
case of emergency. The medical faculty of the capital volunteered
their services in a body; ladies devoted themselves to “ambulance”
work in a manner and on a scale never before witnessed, while volunteers
as <i xml:lang="fr" lang="fr">brancardiers</i> gave their names in numbers beyond requirements<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_241" id="Page_241">241</a></span>
even according to the most liberal estimates of probable casualties.
Thus it came about that provision was complete for 37,000 patients.</p>

<p>At a later period so numerous became the “nurses” that “to carry
a <i xml:lang="fr" lang="fr">brassard</i><a name="FNanchor_280" id="FNanchor_280" href="#Footnote_280" class="fnanchor">280</a> turned into a fashion; young women <i>played</i> the nurse with
wounded soldiers as little girls play the mother with their dolls.” Many
earnest women devoted themselves to the work, but that the remark
just made was not without grounds was no less true. In some instances
the declared object with which they undertook such work was to release
men therefrom, so that they might join the active ranks in combat, or
become <i xml:lang="fr" lang="fr">ambulanciers</i>. In other instances it was said of the ladies so
employed that they restricted their <i>performances</i> to mere show, leaving
all real work in the wards to men, but ready to accept credit really due
to the latter. Instances occurred of wounded Frenchmen submitting a
formal request to be moved to wards in which their attendants should be
men only. Up to a certain time a halo of romance attached itself to the
movement as a whole; latterly the brightness of that “glory” became
less dazzling.</p>

<p>Unfortunately some of the larger ambulance establishments drew
upon themselves suspicion; a report circulated that while above them,
as also some huts or barraques erected for similar purpose, waved the
Red Cross flag, side by side with or in close proximity to them were
stores for combatant purposes,&mdash;&#8203;in at least one instance artillery ready
equipped for battle. There were cynics who said that the profusion of
Geneva flags on private houses was indicative of a desire on the part
of the inmates to claim protection under that emblem, as much as the
wish to share their rapidly diminishing quantity of food and “comforts”
with sick and wounded men. The fact that brancardiers were “neutral”
by virtue of the brassard worn by them was considered by pessimists
to account for the great popularity attached to the Corps of Ambulanciers
as compared to the fighting battalions. Nor were there wanting
persons who expressed views that the entire system of “Sociétés
des Secours” had in it the objection that by their means responsibility
in respect to the care of sick and wounded soldiers was withdrawn from
Governments concerned, and so war protracted beyond what would
otherwise be possible.</p>

sieges.</p></blockquote>

<p class="drop-cap5"><span class="smcap1">Among</span> the “ambulances” visited by me while being prepared for
their intended purpose was one in the near vicinity of the Luxembourg
Palace. A particular club was in process of transition accordingly;
its members, socially distinguished in Parisian society, had arranged
among themselves to undertake the entire management and work,
professional and otherwise, in connection therewith, the female members
of their respective families devoting themselves to the performance of
such functions as pertained more properly to them. In a spacious
apartment of that club-ambulance, a number of ladies were variously
occupied in arranging articles of bedding, night-dresses, bandages, etc.
Among them was one, an Alsacienne, young, fair, and so gentle in
manner, that as she accompanied me through the several apartments
about to become wards, I took leave to ask whether she had formed
any idea as to the nature of the duties that might fall upon her in
relation to wounded men, and, if so, whether she felt that she was
physically capable of them. “Of course,” so she said in reply, “she
could not tell what those duties might be, or if she would be able to
fulfil them; but in such circumstances as now threatened, it was the
duty of every one, man and woman alike, to do their best, and she
hoped to do hers.”</p>

<p>In the early hours of the 19th, the French forces, some 60,000
strong, occupying the heights of Meudon and Chatillon, were
attacked, and driven away by the Germans. It subsequently transpired
that although considerable numbers of the regular soldiers of the line
stood their ground as became them, others, including some Zouaves,
fled panic-stricken; their example was quickly followed by the Mobiles,
and so, as day advanced, great numbers of those classes were seen in<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_243" id="Page_243">243</a></span>
flight along the great thoroughfares of the city, a few of them carrying
their arms, but the great majority without weapons of any kind,
shouting as they fled, “<i xml:lang="fr" lang="fr">Nous sommes trahi!</i>” themselves saluted by the
populace with cries of “<i xml:lang="fr" lang="fr">Lâches</i>.”<a name="FNanchor_281" id="FNanchor_281" href="#Footnote_281" class="fnanchor">281</a> The sight was a melancholy one,
its tendency to impair whatever belief existed in regard to the successful
issue of the defence now entered upon. Still later, ambulance
carriages passed along the streets, bearing their loads of men wounded
in this the first serious engagement in the near vicinity of the capital,
the siege of which begins as a result of that action. As subsequently
expressed by newspaper correspondents, there is little doubt that had
the Prussians followed up the fugitives on this occasion they might with
them have entered Paris.</p>

<p>In the evening of that day the sound of shots fired in the streets was
heard; report spread that two thousand of “the dangerous classes”
were abroad, a report so far confirmed that they were being marched
under escort to the gates, and so expelled, to take their chances
between the lines of besieged and besiegers. It was deemed unsafe
for foreigners to appear, lest, being taken for Prussians, they might
vicariously suffer for the success of the morning. Cafés and such
places were ordered to close early; a declaration published that
persons convicted of pillage should be held liable to death penalty.
The discovery was made that telegraphic communication with the
outer world was cut off. Under all these circumstances there existed
an impression that the risks to life had been lessened to those within
the city by the repulse sustained by our “defenders” in the morning.</p>

<p>On September 21 was celebrated in Paris the outbreak in 1792 of
the Republic, and massacre of French nobles. Placards declared that
the successors of men of that day will prove themselves worthy of their
ancestors; other <i xml:lang="fr" lang="fr">affiches</i> expressed determination to resist to the death,
to accept no armistice, to yield neither a stone of a fortress nor an inch
of territory. In the Place de la Concorde a battalion of the Garde
Nationale presented arms to the statue of Strasbourg, sang in chorus
the Marseillaise, decorated the emblem itself with floral wreaths;
having done so, they marched away! Soon there came a body of
“patriots”; their task to drape the figures of Marseilles and Lyons in
red, in token of the Republic declared at both those places. Along
the Rue Rivoli came a battalion of newly-enrolled citizen soldiers, their
destination said to be the front. At the head of the column marched<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_244" id="Page_244">244</a></span>
in gorgeous and picturesque costume a cantinière. The men’s rifles were
decorated with evergreens; accompanying them were their wives and
children, all in tears; the brave men loudly singing, “<i xml:lang="fr" lang="fr">Mourir pour la
patrie</i>.” As they reached the Rue Royale an affecting and sad parting
was witnessed; the column resumed its march, but now in silence;
but, as subsequently transpired, not to come in conflict with the enemy.</p>

<p>A strange contrast between conditions was now observable. Considerable
numbers of the fugitives from Chatillon were marched along
some thoroughfares, their coats turned outside in, their hands tied
behind them, the word “<i xml:lang="fr" lang="fr">Lâche</i>” placarded on their backs. Masses of
men, including old and young, the strong, decrepid and malformed,
gathered in front of the Hôtel de Ville, and along the boulevards extending
thence to the Place de la Bastille. After a time the crowds
dispersed, but the reason alike of their gathering and of their dispersion
did not then <span class="locked">transpire.<a name="FNanchor_282" id="FNanchor_282" href="#Footnote_282" class="fnanchor">282</a></span> Meanwhile, the aspect of the boulevards was
bright and gay with women fashionably dressed, and men in uniform;
the cafés crowded, their inmates laughing and joyous. At the kiosks
people eagerly purchased papers of the day, and laughed at the
caricatures of Germans, executed in even worse style, if that were
possible, than anything previously seen. In the Champs Elysées goat
carriages and merry-go-rounds, Mobiles playing games of sorts, nursery
maids neglecting their charges, men squabbling, songs, patriotic and
ribald, half-drunken men everywhere.</p>

<p>Events developed rapidly. The sound of heavy guns at different
points around the outskirts told its own tale. The heaviest firing came
from the direction of Meudon. Crowds of people gathered at the
Trocadero, and there watched for explosions of Prussian shells as they
burst in mid air or crashed through the leafy woods adjoining the
Seine, though at some distance from the city. A balloon dispatched
from within glided westward at an elevation beyond the reach of
Prussian fire; the balloon, as we subsequently learned, being guided
by M. Nadar, who, while passing over their camp, dropped showers of
his own advertisements among them.</p>

<p>Now the theatres were in some instances turned to another purpose
than that of mere amusement; they were transformed into ambulances,
the male portion of the usual performers taking their places in the
fighting ranks, the ladies adopting the brassard as nurses. Another
significant incident was the barricading of doors and windows of the
Louvre Museum, a number of water reservoirs being prepared near it,
in case of fire, and with evident regard to possible bombardment.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_245" id="Page_245">245</a></span>
The inhabitants of villages within the line of investment were admitted
inside the ramparts; there they became established as so many
communities, each under its own administration. Conditions, present
and prospective, pointed to the necessity of systematising the issue of
food stores; meat was unobtainable at butchers’ establishments and
restaurants. A register was established on which was inscribed the
names and residence of persons authorized to remain within the walls,
these numbering two millions, exclusive of <i xml:lang="fr" lang="fr">bouches inutiles</i> already
expelled.</p>

<p>From academies and medical schools students enrolled themselves
as artillerymen and ambulanciers. So popular was the last-named
corps that many fictitious “members” were soon arrested for bearing
its brassard. In some instances it was said of citizen “soldiers” that
they showed small desire to take post in advanced positions; in a few,
that Gardes Nationaux and Mobiles objected to proceed beyond the
barriers. While on the one hand certain enthusiasts endeavoured to set
on foot a League of Peace, others proposed schemes of mutual assurance
against casualties incidental to a state of siege. Still went on the
work of destroying emblems and changing the names of streets associated
with that of Napoleon. A proposal was made to strip from the
column in the Place Vendome the historical scenes on its metal
casing, and utilise the bronze for purposes of defence. Wives of
workmen on barricades and other defences might be seen carrying
the implements of their husbands, while the latter lounged about unencumbered,
and in all respects unlike earnest <i xml:lang="fr" lang="fr">ouvriers</i>. In the
long hours of inactivity that intervened between short periods of
indifferent work, tongues and idle hands became in their respective
ways so demonstrative that, as a counterpoise, a series of cheap performances
“for the benefit of the masses” was organized. In the pages
of <i xml:lang="fr" lang="fr">Le Combat</i> was a proposal that a subscription list should be opened,
with a view to present a <i xml:lang="fr" lang="fr">fusil d’honneur</i> to the man who should shoot
the King of Prussia, the subscriptions to be limited to five sous per
person. Prussian helmets were offered for sale in such numbers that
people asked each other how far off was their place of manufacture.</p>

<p>Ten days elapsed since the Prussians gained their position on the
heights of Chatillon. Meanwhile it would seem that beyond slight
combats nothing of importance occurred between besieged and besiegers.
Rumour ran that “the people”&mdash;&#8203;within Paris&mdash;&#8203;demanded to be led
against the enemy by whom their city was surrounded, while the daily
journals advocated such a demonstration, if for no other object than
to quiet such of the disaffected as declaimed against the past inaction.
On September 30 a combined force of the line, artillery, cavalry,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_246" id="Page_246">246</a></span>
National Guards and Mobiles, said to number in all 10,000 men, attacked
the Prussians at Villejuif, where at first they were successful. At
another point, however,&mdash;&#8203;namely, Choisy-le-Roi,&mdash;&#8203;the result of the
incautious rush made by them was unfortunate to themselves; they
sustained heavy loss in killed and wounded,&mdash;&#8203;General Guilhém being
among the former,&mdash;&#8203;and were constrained to withdraw behind the
adjoining forts.</p>

<p>During the interval between those actions I visited several ambulances,
containing considerable numbers of wounded, and now much
added to by those from the sortie just mentioned. Among those
visited was the one near the Luxembourg Palace already noticed.
But the Alsacienne was no longer there. On the fatal day of Chatillon,
among the wounded carried thither from the field was an officer
whose injury was of the gravest nature. To him was assigned an
apartment; he was placed under sole charge of the young nurse,
whose first patient he thus became. Night closed in; the surgeons
attended to his injuries; then patient and “nurse” were left together.
With return of daylight came the morning visit. On the bed lay stiff
and cold what had been the wounded man; kneeling beside the bed,
her face buried in the sheets, herself in a state of catalepsy, was the
nurse, her condition so sad and extreme that she was straightway
taken to her friends, with whom, as subsequently transpired, she long
remained an invalid.</p>

<p>All of us recognised the fact that the attendant conditions of a
siege were upon us, that with regard to their future course everything
was uncertain. Under such circumstances we read with interest a
resumé of the history of past sieges of Paris, published apparently for
our encouragement in one of the morning <span class="locked">journals.<a name="FNanchor_283" id="FNanchor_283" href="#Footnote_283" class="fnanchor">283</a></span> It appears that
Paris has undergone seven different sieges; namely, in <span class="smcap smaller">A.D.</span> 856&ndash;7, by
the Normans, for thirteen months, at which date its population numbered
60,000 persons; on that occasion, though the besiegers committed
great destruction in its immediate environs, they were ultimately
obliged to withdraw. In 970, the Emperor Otho II., with 60,000
troops, appeared before its walls; but he was routed by King Lothaire,
and pursued as far as Soissons. In 1359 Charles of Navarre blockaded
the city, and tried to reduce it by famine; the population suffered
intensely, but in the end, Charles, learning of the approach of relieving
armies, raised the siege, and with his forces withdrew. In November
of the same year, Edward III. of England invaded France with
100,000 men, and marched on Paris the following spring. At that<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_247" id="Page_247">247</a></span>
time Paris contained 200,000 inhabitants. During the siege, which
lasted three months, they suffered the horrors of famine, but the troops
of Edward, having devastated all the surrounding country, became
themselves short of provisions, and were consequently compelled to
withdraw. A century later, the English, under Edward IV., who became
possessed of the city, were attacked by Charles VII., whom they
had before driven to Bourges, and Joan of Arc was wounded at the
head of a storming party. Finally the French were repulsed. For
seven years Paris was “between the hammer and the anvil,” till at
last the citizens revolted against the exactions of the English, and let
the French into the place. In 1589, at which time Henry IV. laid
claim to the throne of France, the king’s army attacked the Faubourg
St. Germain; after which the siege was raised for a few months, to be
renewed in 1590. On that occasion the siege lasted eighty-five days;
namely, from May 30 to August 23. The populace were reduced
to such straits that animals of all kinds, clean and unclean, were
slaughtered; soldiers chased children, and put them to death as food;
bones were dug up and prepared as <i xml:lang="fr" lang="fr">patés</i>; an instance related of a
woman who devoured some of the flesh of her own offspring, and
shortly afterwards died mad&mdash;&#8203;and no wonder. At the end of that
time the approach of the Duke of Parma forced Henry to raise the
siege. In 1814 and in 1815 the city capitulated without a battle.
The seventh siege is now in progress. It is for us to fulfil our destiny
to the best of our ability.</p>

<p class="drop-cap3"><span class="smcap1">Early</span> in October <span class="locked">two<a name="FNanchor_284" id="FNanchor_284" href="#Footnote_284" class="fnanchor">284</a></span> of us proceeded some way by Ceinture
Railway, the more conveniently to see conditions beyond the
walls. The Bois de Boulogne was sadly transformed in aspect; trees
recklessly cut down, flower beds destroyed, troops already established
in camps, others preparing for themselves bowers of branches, while
from Mont Valérien the frequent recurring boom of heavy guns told of
missiles directed therefrom upon strong positions of the enemy on the
heights of Meudon.</p>

<p>Descending at Porte Montrouge, it was with some difficulty we
obtained permission from the Etat Major to go outside that part of the
fortifications. Proceeding along what once had been the road to
Bicètre, we came upon and passed a succession of barricades.
On either side of our route were gardens and fields now laid waste,
hamlets and villages deserted, houses dilapidated, and in many
instances destroyed, the better to clear the way for artillery fire upon
our besiegers; at short intervals a thin layer of earth concealed a
torpedo. Still further towards the front, outlying sentries of the contending
forces exchanged stray shots with each other.</p>

<p>At Arcueil the Dominican College, transformed to an ambulance, was
filled with wounded men. Among them was a German soldier, he
belonging to the 23rd Infantry, the first of the enemy with whom, so
far, we had become acquainted. He was not only well cared for, but
petted by those around him, and, to judge by expression, was well<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_249" id="Page_249">249</a></span>
contented with his surroundings. In course of our trip we came upon
various parties of troops of the line marching to their front, for already
we were within range of the Prussian needle gun. In one of those
parties was a man upon whose knapsack was perched a cat, which
clung to its position as best it could. It was probably the creature the
man loved best.</p>

<p>On another occasion of an excursion by the Ceinture we witnessed
the conflagration by which the palace of St. Cloud utterly perished.
From various positions artillery fire was continuous. As we watched,
first a mass of dense smoke, then of lurid flame, burst from the edifice,
and speedily the whole was in a state of ruin. Subsequently it was
said that to the French themselves was due this great mishap; whether
by intention or accident did not transpire.</p>

<p>Among the historical associations connected with that palace the
following may be noticed: In it on July 29, 1589, Henry III. was
murdered by the monk Jacques Clément; Henrietta of Orleans died;
Peter the Great was received by the Regency in the time of Louis XIV.
There was signed the capitulation of Paris in 1815; Queen Victoria was
received by Napoleon III. in 1855; and in 1870 the Declaration of
War against Prussia was signed. Strangely enough, the table used on
the last-named occasion was among the few articles saved from the
conflagration just witnessed.</p>

<p>Signs of the times multiplied apace. Sounds of firing by heavy guns
became more and more distinct and continuous, conversation turning
upon the circumstance as if it were an ordinary though interesting
subject. Precautions against <i xml:lang="fr" lang="fr">incendie</i> were pressed on. Demonstrations
of various kinds took place in the different parts of the city, the
people composing them comprising numbers of those from Belleville
and Mobiles bearing arms. At most of them the Marseillaise with
other <i>patriotic</i> music mingled with denunciations against the besiegers,
against whom, however, those who most loudly denounced seemed to
consider further personal action unnecessary. Nor did the Provisional
Government escape their declamations, the expressions against it being
in some instances no less strong than those against the Prussians.</p>

<p>A post by balloon and the employment of carrier pigeons had been
already introduced, the first for the dispatch of communications, the
second for their conveyance to the authorities within the city. The
first so brought in was a Proclamation by Gambetta, who had by
means of aerial transit proceeded to Tours. By photography it was
reduced to a minimum size, and so attached to a pigeon; by a reverse
method it was enlarged, and so made legible. Throughout the remaining
period of the siege letters were regularly dispatched by balloon to<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_250" id="Page_250">250</a></span>
those dear to me; but weeks had to elapse before intimation from the
outside world was <span class="locked">received.<a name="FNanchor_285" id="FNanchor_285" href="#Footnote_285" class="fnanchor">285</a></span></p>

<p>The arrival of Colonel Lloyd Lindsay in the middle of October as
bearer of £20,000, a donation from England to the sick and wounded
in Paris, was an important event. He entered the city in the uniform
of his rank. The spy mania was still strong; he was captured as such,
and underwent various unpleasant experiences notwithstanding the
philanthropic character of his mission. By order of General Le Flo,
Minister of War, I became a member of the Committee appointed to
distribute “le don Anglais,” and fulfilled the duty as best I could.
Looking back through the vista of many years doubts occur as to the
actual amount of good effected by that <i>don</i>. While it was in process
of distribution, jealousies were expressed among <span class="locked">institutions<a name="FNanchor_286" id="FNanchor_286" href="#Footnote_286" class="fnanchor">286</a></span> to which
portions of it were given, while among various classes of persons the
remark was heard, “It is all very well to send us money, but France
expected aid of another and more active kind.” Nor were the French
singular in the views expressed, if information subsequently gained is
correct.</p>

<p>Those who, as already alluded to, claimed rights and privileges as
British subjects had to be seen to by countrymen able to afford partial
help in the circumstances of the time. Previous to the departure of
their Representative, intimation was sent to them that they also were at
liberty to quit the threatened city; but if they preferred to remain, they<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_251" id="Page_251">251</a></span>
did so on their individual responsibility. So stringent were orders left
with regard to the “British Charitable Fund” that help therefrom
could only be given under authority of that Representative, and it
impossible to obtain after his departure. As expressed by some of the
persons alluded to, “What could they do by quitting Paris? All
their possessions were in the city; so were their homes; if they were
to die of starvation, better do so there than away, shelterless and
wanderers among strangers and possibly enemies. Their means of
obtaining or earning income had for the time being ceased; unless
aided by compatriots, they must perish.” An extemporized Board of
<span class="locked">Assistance<a name="FNanchor_287" id="FNanchor_287" href="#Footnote_287" class="fnanchor">287</a></span> obtained for and distributed among them help, and to
those suffering from illness professional aid. But in all this the official
element had no part.</p>

<p>The current of events had made two points clear: the first that in the
annihilation of her army at Sedan, France was subjected to an emergency
not calculated upon or provided against; the second, equally unforeseen,
that a powerful army was rapidly strengthening an investing circle
around her capital. Such measures as were adopted under the combined
circumstances must needs be taken on the spur of the moment,
and from materials ready at hand, these facts to be borne in mind by
those of us who were mere <span class="locked">lookers-on.<a name="FNanchor_288" id="FNanchor_288" href="#Footnote_288" class="fnanchor">288</a></span></p>

<p>Works of defence included the strengthening of forts and ramparts
already existing; the erection of barricades, and other operations
incidental to conditions at the time existing. Workmen unused to
such requirements had to be employed, the results being disproportion
between labourers numerically and in their performances, alike in
quantity and in quality. Much of their time was spent in trifling, in
“demonstrations,” in drinking, singing, and fighting with comrades
who had joined the ranks as “soldiers”; others of them were loud in
demands for arms, though, as subsequently shown, those given to them
were misused. The general result of these conditions was that when
October had came to an end defensive works were still incomplete.</p>

<p>The line of action, and of what was looked upon as inaction by
some of the higher military officers, was subject of talk and comment.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_252" id="Page_252">252</a></span>
Of the <span class="locked">Governor<a name="FNanchor_289" id="FNanchor_289" href="#Footnote_289" class="fnanchor">289</a></span> it was said that in these respects his policy
was enigmatical; his sympathies were more with the deposed Emperor
than towards the Republic, holding communication with the Empress
and her enemies, but abandoning her in her time of greatest difficulty.
Little fitted to conduct the duties of a leader; more able to detect
administrative faults than to remedy them; vacillating in opinion;
liable to adopt the views of the latest speaker in an interview; making
promises which he left unfulfilled; substituting phrases for action;
circulars and proclamations for force of arms; his demeanour between
opposing factions so equivocal that he was doubted and mistrusted
by all. Having little confidence in the “armed men” under his
command, and in ultimate success of the defence, his object in continuing
it was that he might so “maintain the honour of France.”
Disbelieving in the continuance of the Republic, his hopes were in
restoration of the deposed Emperor: an event towards which the policy
of Bazaine at Metz was deemed likely to conduce. Towards his
officers, personal feelings rather than public considerations dictated
his demeanour; thus his supersession of Vinoy by Ducrot at Chatillon
was considered to have led to misfortune on that occasion, as ill-feeling
towards Bellemere did subsequently at Le Bourget. It was said
of another general officer that on September 4 he was in command
of the line at the Corps Legislatif, who fraternized with the National
Guards, and on the 19th abandoned his position at Chatillon, re-entering
Paris with other fugitives.</p>

<p>That among staff and other officers were men whose reputation stood
high was acknowledged. But an impression was abroad that the
former class were so numerous that individual efficiency was thereby
impaired, while battalions suffered in consequence of their withdrawal.
That there were some who scarcely gave the impression of efficiency
was no less apparent. These were to be seen lounging about cafés
and boulevards, usually in exaggerated uniform and trappings, their
hands encased in <i>manchons</i>.<a name="FNanchor_290" id="FNanchor_290" href="#Footnote_290" class="fnanchor">290</a> On the line of march towards advanced
positions, the frequency with which a few of the latter resorted to the
artistes who <i>acted</i> as <i xml:lang="fr" lang="fr">vivandières</i> was subject of not admiring wonder
to foreigners who looked on. While in actual movement the process
of electing their officers was gone through by some battalions of
“Federals.” On such occasions, political considerations seemed to outweigh
those of military efficiency. Men have been seen soliciting
votes with bottle in hand; in some instances men “elected” refused to
accept the distinction; in others, altercations were to be seen between
individuals.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_253" id="Page_253">253</a></span>
The rank and file of the “defenders” were more formidable in
numbers than efficiency. It was felt that in creating such a force arms
of precision were placed in the hands of men belonging to recognised
“dangerous classes,” nor was the difficulty that might possibly arise
in getting from them again those arms unperceived by responsible
authorities. Subsequent events sufficiently proved it would have been
better for Paris and for France had such a force not been organized,
had terms of peace been arranged prior to the calling together of
“Federal” elements. With the exception of relatively small numbers
of the old army and marines, the defence was to be carried out by
levies, of whom it was said that “they comprised the old and the young;
the hale and the lame, gamblers, and the disturbers of the peace.”
These elements thrown together promiscuously were formed into
battalions, but otherwise they were without cohesion or affinity.</p>

<p>Of the regular cavalry, the numbers available for service were small,
not exceeding some 5,000 men, and not all these were employed in the
face of the enemy. The artillery was made up in part of regular
soldiers of that branch, partly of marines, and partly of Mobiles; thus
it presented the two extremes of excellence and non-efficiency&mdash;&#8203;the old
soldiers presenting the former of these characteristics, those newly
drafted into the ranks the latter. The Zouaves, of whose achievements
we were already accustomed to hear so much, and from whom so much
was expected, failed altogether to fulfil those anticipations; in some
instances showing defection and panic in the face of the enemy, in
others such feeble resistance that they came to be looked upon as
useless against trained soldiers inured to battle.</p>

<p>The National <span class="locked">Guard<a name="FNanchor_291" id="FNanchor_291" href="#Footnote_291" class="fnanchor">291</a></span> was distinct from the army proper; it had its
own laws and code of regulations. The Mobile Guard was assimilated
to the active army for purposes of pay and discipline&mdash;&#8203;like the
line, organized in distinct battalions. While the German forces were
at a considerable distance from the capital, several corps of Mobiles
were brought thither from the provinces. No sooner had the Republic
been declared than several of their members were among the first
of the insurgents to force their way into the Tuileries, from which the
escape of the Empress had not yet been effected. When, immediately
thereafter, orders were issued within Paris for the enrolment of such
troops, those orders were obeyed to a partial extent only; evasions
were frequent, desertions numerous. If in their ranks there were
some trustworthy men, report stated that there was also a dangerously<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_254" id="Page_254">254</a></span>
large proportion of fugitives from justice, and of the criminal classes.
Subsequent experience proved that such elements were more ready to
declare for the Commune than to face the besiegers; that when led to
the front they speedily withdrew therefrom, although on such occasions
their casualties were <i>nil</i>.</p>

<p>To many of the extemporized troops the declaration of the Republic
was looked upon as giving them the right to trangress law and order,
to claim whatever they chose at the moment to desire, but to give
nothing in return. Fraternizing with the worst elements of Belleville
and Vilette, they early joined them in demonstrations against existing
government: and being billeted upon the civil population, evil influences
were spread from class to class, to the serious danger of public
administration.</p>

<p>Various corps of Francs Tireurs were extemporised. With regard to
them as a body, it has been said that for the most part the men were
bad soldiers, acting according to their individual pleasure; marauders
not only with regard to the enemy, but to the French, whom they were
supposed to assist. By the Germans they were looked upon as
assassins, and dealt with accordingly, whenever they fell into the hands
of our besiegers. It is true that among them there were good men,
but so relatively small their numbers that their influence upon the
general <i>morale</i> was imperceptible. There was at least one corps
among them whose bearing and efficiency was unquestionable, namely,
Franchetti’s <i xml:lang="fr" lang="fr">Eclaireurs à Cheval de la Seine</i>; but, unfortunately for
them, their gallant commander fell in battle before the operations
were nearly over. As a body, the reputation accorded to the Francs
Tireurs was that they fled before small bodies of the Germans, by whom
in consequence they were looked upon with contempt.</p>

<p>A movement of very unusual kind was suggested, and although
never carried out deserves to be noticed in these reminiscences. The
intended movement was none other than a demand on the part of a
number of women that in the first place they should be granted “social
solidarity,” whatever that may mean; and in the second, should be
drafted into a series of battalions, armed and clothed suitably to their
sex; that those battalions should have the designation from one to ten
of the “Amazones de la Seine”; that they should “man” the ramparts,
and so take the places of battalions proceeding more to the <span class="locked">front.<a name="FNanchor_292" id="FNanchor_292" href="#Footnote_292" class="fnanchor">292</a></span></p>

<p>A Council of Hygiene was early organized to take upon itself the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_255" id="Page_255">255</a></span>
various duties relating to public health, that is so far as it could be protected
under the circumstances in which the city was placed. The
gradually diminishing food supplies, including milk, produced evil
effects in the aged, the very young, and the sick; ordinary diseases
incidental to the season of the year increased in prevalence, while
small-pox did so to an extent which ultimately merited the name of a
pestilence. Vaccination became compulsory, and it was a somewhat
amusing sight, even under the conditions of the time, to see whole
battalions of citizen soldiers being marched to the École de Médecine,
there to undergo that operation.</p>

<p>An important <span class="locked">sortie<a name="FNanchor_293" id="FNanchor_293" href="#Footnote_293" class="fnanchor">293</a></span> against Prussian positions on the west of Paris
took place on October 21, the first on a large scale that had as yet
been made. The several ambulances established within the city dispatched
to the field no fewer than two hundred carriages of sorts in
anticipation of a severely contested battle. Among them were eight
from the American, situated in the Avenue de l’Impératrice, the carriages
well and elegantly built, each horsed by four high-bred animals
from the stables of wealthy Americans, the <i>personnel</i> in smart uniform,
the <i xml:lang="fr" lang="fr">matériel</i> provided on a most liberal scale, the whole in a state of
completeness for its expected work. As the cavalcade stood, drawn up
in regular order, all eyes were turned towards Mont Valérien, from
which three guns fired in quick succession were to be the signal for the
general advance. About noon the appointed signal was given. Away
started, in their assigned order, the line of carriages; down by the Avenue
de la Grande Armée towards Port Maillot, they went at rapid pace,
attracting the admiration of pedestrians, many of whom waved their
hats in token thereof. Arrived at Courbevoie, the appointed rendezvous
of the ambulance services, <span class="locked">we<a name="FNanchor_294" id="FNanchor_294" href="#Footnote_294" class="fnanchor">294</a></span> were directed by an Intendant to take
up position on a vine-clad ridge behind Mont Valérien, midway between
Reuil and Bougeval, towards both of which places the active
forces were advancing. Two French batteries in our immediate front
opened fire upon the enemy; one of the two, consisting of mitrailleuses&mdash;&#8203;being
so directed as to sweep the valley that intervened between
the ridges on which were respectively posted the guns of besiegers and
besieged. Across that valley, but partly hidden by vine bushes, a strong
infantry force of Germans was in progress towards us, while stretching
away on our right battalions were making progress towards the enemy.
The fight quickly became developed, artillery and infantry fire from
contending sides becoming increasingly rapid and destructive. That<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_256" id="Page_256">256</a></span>
from the batteries close to our position, though less regular than what
in actions in the Mutiny campaign we had opportunities of observing
as directed against the rebels, was so to a degree beyond what we had
been led to expect, considering the materials of which the defending
and extemporized forces were composed. The mitrailleuses were new
to us, hence their performances were observed with all the greater
interest; the general impression left upon us that their destructiveness
in the open fell short of anticipations. In our immediate vicinity and
along the line of combat, casualties became so numerous that the best
energies of our ambulanciers were fully taxed. The approach of evening
told that hostilities must soon cease. Our carriages now filled with
wounded, sixty-four in all were collected, and so began their journey
back towards Paris. It was dark when we re-entered the gate by which
a few hours earlier we had emerged; the great thoroughfare towards the
Arc de Triomphe was dimly lighted by oil lamps, for the manufacture
of gas had ceased with the expenditure of reserve coal. From the
crowds at Port Maillot came loudly expressed inquiries for friends who
perchance might be among our wounded. As we continued our progress,
people formed dense lines on either side of the broad avenue; hats
were respectfully raised; our further progress was between rows of
uncovered heads&mdash;&#8203;a touching and spontaneous mark of appreciation and
deference to the Red Cross establishments of which we were members.
The results to the French of this great sortie were unfortunate, the
casualties on their side very heavy. Among the subjects of those
casualties were an ex-consul at Stettin, two popular landscape painters,
and a sculptor, all of whom fought in the ranks as private soldiers.</p>

<p>The events during the next few days were in their several ways
characteristic of the time and circumstances. The press boasted that
seventy German soldiers had been captured at, and brought into the
city from, the late battle, while rumour ran that the captives were cast
into the ordinary prisons, there to associate with the criminal population
of such places. Seasonal cold was rapidly increasing in severity;
the supply of fuel giving way, the issues of food, already under strict
supervision, were still more rigidly superintended; the quantities allowed
per ration curtailed, not only in respect to persons in health, but for
the sick and wounded. The explosion of an establishment devoted to
the manufacture of Orsini bombs caused a good deal of injury to life
and property, at the same time that the attention of the authorities was
thereby drawn to the circumstance that those implements were being
prepared on an extensive scale, but for use within the walls, rather than
against the enemy still beyond the lines of fortification. The diminishing
supply of materials for the manufacture of gunpowder directed<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_257" id="Page_257">257</a></span>
attention to the catacombs as a possible source whence in greater
emergency saltpetre might be obtained. Between National and
Mobile Guards quarrels occurred from the circumstance that the former
were employed only on the fortifications, while the latter were sent to
the front, there to engage against the enemy. As the readiest way of
solving the difficulty it was ordered that “the citizen soldiers should in
their turn be taken beyond those lines, in order that they might be
gradually accustomed to the sight of the enemy.”</p>

<p>An excursion to the village of Boulogne brought me face to face with
an incident new to me in “civilized” warfare. That small town, once
the favourite resort of visitors, was now reduced to utter dilapidation;
its ordinary occupants fled; its ruins giving shelter more or less complete
to defending troops; its streets barricaded; garden and other
walls loopholed. Through some of those loopholes sentries took aim
at isolated Germans, as the latter came into view among the woods in
which they were posted; at others, a sentry for a small “tip” handed
his rifle to a stray visitor to have a shot at <i xml:lang="fr" lang="fr">le Prusse</i>. It was not long,
however, before a rattle of rifle bullets on the wall put a stop to this
kind of “sport.” From Valérien and other forts heavy continuous firing
went on, their missiles directed upon particular points of the German
position, where siege batteries were in course of erection for possible
bombardment of our city; from those positions an equally active shellfire
upon French outposts went steadily on.</p>

<p>Among the minor events of the time, one was the addition of several
battalions of Federals to those already existing. Another, an attempt
made to suppress the extent to which cantinières had come to march at
the head of battalions. The grounds of that attempt included the fact
that in all instances such followers were young girls, many of them little
more than children, who were thus exposed to temptation while beyond
the observation and care of their parents or other guardians.</p>

<p>For once in a way our besiegers appear to have been taken unawares.
At Le Bourget, towards the end of <span class="locked">October,<a name="FNanchor_295" id="FNanchor_295" href="#Footnote_295" class="fnanchor">295</a></span> a small body was successfully
attacked by Francs Tireurs and Mobiles. But their success was of
brief duration. Report circulated that reinforcements applied for by
Bellemere were refused by Trochu, that refusal the outcome of personal
feeling. Be that as it may, an attack in force was speedily
delivered by the Germans; the position <span class="locked">carried,<a name="FNanchor_296" id="FNanchor_296" href="#Footnote_296" class="fnanchor">296</a></span> with great slaughter of
the occupants. There was consternation in Paris. All through the
31st the streets were in a state of turmoil. Masses of people, the great
majority armed, marched towards the Hôtel de Ville; that building<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_258" id="Page_258">258</a></span>
surrounded by them; the members of the Defence made prisoners;
cries of “Vive la Commune!” interspersed with yells, and clarion blasts
everywhere; the Commune was in fact declared. But not for long.
The 106th Battalion of National Guards forced their way through the
insurgents, rescued the Government, and so saved the capital from
scenes which were to disgrace it four months later on, in which scenes
the same battalion was to play so iniquitous a part.</p>

<p>The extent to which sickness prevailed within the city had become
alarming. Accommodation and other necessities for the suffering were
severely taxed; for although regular combats between the opposing
forces were not frequent, the results from collisions of daily occurrence,
and of almost continuous fire from the batteries of the enemy, were a
large influx of wounded men. Funeral processions along the cold
sloppy streets were of constant occurrence. Certain maladies, among
them small-pox, prevailed to a great and fatal extent. As if to emphasize
these conditions, news circulated that Metz had <span class="locked">capitulated;<a name="FNanchor_297" id="FNanchor_297" href="#Footnote_297" class="fnanchor">297</a></span>
a large portion of the investing force thus set free on its way to increase
that of the besiegers around Paris. So ended the month.</p>

<p class="drop-cap5"><span class="smcap1">Le</span> Jour des Morts was devoted to visiting the cemetery of Père la
Chaise. That vast city of the silent was more than usually
crowded with mourners and other visitors. Recently covered graves
were numerous; around many such stood sorrowing relatives and
friends, some of whom placed thereon wreaths or other tokens of
affection; around others stood similar groups, some of whom redecorated
tombs of those longer numbered among the dead. The
assembled crowds were grave and demure, as befitted the occasion. At
intervals the sound of heavy guns came as if floating on the air. On
reaching the higher ground within the cemetery, the sharp <i>ping</i> of
German rifle shots came sharply and often, as the missiles passed overhead
or fell among us; for it seemed as if they were directed upon the
mourners by the more advanced posts of the besiegers out of a spirit
of wantonness&mdash;&#8203;not unlike, it must be confessed, that already shown by
French sentries <i>and others</i> at Boulogne. But “it was not war” in either
instance.</p>

<p>A requiem mass in the Madeleine for victims of the war up to that
date was a most impressive service. That beautiful church, draped in
black for the occasion, was filled to crowding by men and women, belonging
to all social grades, those of the higher classes wearing deep
mourning, all having lost members of their families on the field of battle,
or by disease which had already assumed the character of pestilence; in
near proximity to the altar sat some few mutilated men, who had so far
escaped with their lives. While the service was in progress, the rich
music of the recently erected organ, then used for the first time, was
broken in upon from time to time by the sound of heavy artillery from
the outer forts. During the address delivered by the Abbé Deguerry<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_260" id="Page_260">260</a></span>
the same accompaniment continued. In less than four months thereafter
the venerable and respected Abbé was numbered among the
victims of the <span class="locked">Commune.<a name="FNanchor_298" id="FNanchor_298" href="#Footnote_298" class="fnanchor">298</a></span></p>

<p>Political excitement was rampant within the city; serious outbreak by
the inhabitants of Belleville and Vilette was dreaded; but on the result
being declared of elections rendered necessary by recent events at the
Hôtel de Ville, the disturbing elements accepted for a time the defeat
thereby given to their cause, and gradually became less demonstrative
in behaviour. But not for long. The publication of orders for reorganization
of the National Guard was immediately followed by renewed
disturbances in those localities, from neither of which did men volunteer
for the ranks in obedience to the call do so; some battalions, already
including members from those quarters, refused to take their turn of
duty on the ramparts, declaring their intention to plunder the city if such
orders were persisted in. The difficulties of the existing Government
had become very great. Public loans for purposes of the defence
were called for and subscribed. Negotiations were carried on for an
armistice, whether with or without <i xml:lang="fr" lang="fr">ravitaillement</i>. These proved <span class="locked">unsuccessful;<a name="FNanchor_299" id="FNanchor_299" href="#Footnote_299" class="fnanchor">299</a></span>
but, as events were subsequently to show, acceptance of the
terms of Bismarck, hard as they were, would have saved much suffering
and loss of human life.</p>

<p>Winter weather rapidly advanced; strong winds, rain, and sleet gave
way to snow and bitter frost. Clothing had to be supplemented in
various ways; skins of animals slaughtered were utilised, and articles of
various kinds “converted” in a manner heretofore unknown. Fuel had
become scarce. The public markets were bare of all things eatable;
horses and other draught animals belonging to private individuals were
requisitioned; licences issued by the municipality to official classes and
others permitted to retain and draw rations for particular specified numbers;
an embargo was placed upon the small fish already mentioned as
furnishing sport for anglers on the Seine. All persons were placed on
the universal ration <span class="locked">scale,<a name="FNanchor_300" id="FNanchor_300" href="#Footnote_300" class="fnanchor">300</a></span> but “the poor” had the additional advantage
of gratuitous meals provided at certain places by mairies. The
more respectable classes refused to so declare themselves; the consequence
was that little, if any, advantage in the way of free meals reached
them, whereas the disturbing elements of Belleville and Vilette reaped
the full advantages of the scheme, while the classes alluded to became
gradually reduced to direst poverty and privation. The wounded increased<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_261" id="Page_261">261</a></span>
rapidly in numbers; disease in ordinary forms and as epidemics
acquired alarming prevalence, various hotels and other large buildings
being taken up as additional hospitals. Some schools and colleges still
remained open; the Théâtre Française and a few similar establishments
presented the ordinary scenes of performances in one portion of the
buildings; while in others lay wounded men, sick, dying, and dead.</p>

<p>From outside came evidences that our besiegers were actively at
work. Intervals between rounds of fire from Prussian guns became
shorter as time wore on. From French outposts came reports that
siege batteries were being erected, and armed with Krupp guns of large
calibre, with the evident object of bombarding the city. Additional
measures were taken to interfere with communication, such as it was,
between Paris and the provinces, even to the extent of keeping a more
than usual sharp look-out upon messenger pigeons, many of these birds
having failed to arrive. Two, if not more, of our balloons, while floating
across positions occupied by our enemies, were brought to earth by their
bullets, or otherwise fallen into their hands, their occupants threatened
with trial by Court-Martial on charges of unauthorizedly attempting to
traverse the circle of investment.</p>

<p>In the year 1814, and again in 1815, the allied army entered Paris
by the Porte St. Denis. The impression arose that an entrance by our
besiegers was possibly intended on the present occasion to take place
from the same direction; the defences on that side were accordingly
strengthened to so great an extent that those of us able to do so took
an opportunity of visiting them. One entire cold foggy day was so spent
by me, the Red Cross card procuring for me ready admittance, and
“circulation” everywhere. Rumour said that on some of the advanced
posts in this direction, men of the opposing forces were wont, during
the long weary hours of night, to meet in friendly intercourse and partake
of such small hospitality as they could, leaving for the morrow their<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_262" id="Page_262">262</a></span>
respective transition from “friends” to “enemies.” Records of the
Peninsular War relate similar stories in reference thereto.</p>

<p>As the end of November drew near, rumour spread that the outer
gates of the city had been closed; that a sortie on a greater scale than
any of those preceding was about to take place; that the investing circle
was to be broken, and the victorious army from Paris to march triumphantly
into the provinces. Along the thoroughfares of the city leading
eastward marched battery after battery of artillery and battalion after
battalion of infantry; the crowds cheered, general excitement prevailed;
high-sounding promises were expressed that our isolation from the outside
world was about to cease. Towards evening orders reached those
concerned that early on the morrow the attack was to be delivered; at
the same time the publication of a subsequently much jeered at “Proclamation”
by a general officer became the subject of comment. At
the early hour of one o’clock the following morning a heavy cannonade
was opened upon the positions held by the enemy from the whole line of
forts on the west and south of the city, and continued during the succeeding
hours, so heavy indeed that according to calculation some two
hundred missiles per minute were discharged upon them, while a no
less furious bombardment was opened upon our outposts, the continuous
bursting of shells in mid air of a grey foggy morning having a most
weird effect. Throughout those weary hours equipages of all kinds to be
used in the removal of wounded were being collected and arranged by
the Intendance; while on the river, rows of <i xml:lang="fr" lang="fr">bateaux mouches</i>, ready
prepared for similar work, were moored to the embankment. At length
morning broke, and such a morning! bitterly cold, a dense fog hanging
over us; we, several hours without shelter or refreshment, our innate
powers of maintaining animal warmth materially reduced by privation
of food. Hour after hour passed, and we were still in our assigned
positions; some few conveyances and boats took their departure for the
front, but that was all. Noon passed; afternoon advanced. Rumour
spread that the intended attack on the position at Champigny had miscarried;
that during the previous night the Marne had come down in
flood, available pontoons proved insufficient in the emergency, the
passage of the forces across the stream had to be postponed. We knew
that on the morrow the attempt would be renewed, but all perceived
that meantime preparations against that attack would be made by those
upon whom it was to be directed.</p>

<p>As daylight broke on November 30 heavy cannonading as on the
previous day began. Now the long line of conveyances was set in
motion eastward, along the road between Charenton and the Seine.
As we neared Joinville we met an escort party conveying to the city a<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_263" id="Page_263">263</a></span>
considerable number of German soldiers who had fallen into their
hands. At the same time we learned, what subsequent information
confirmed, that the first onslaught by our besieged troops was so far
successful, the village of Champigny being attacked by them; the
mitrailleuse sweeping its streets, the Wurtembergers and Saxons by
whom it was occupied were driven from it with extremely heavy loss to
their numbers. During the past night the bridge across the Marne
that had suffered from the mania of destruction already mentioned was
temporarily repaired, a bridge of boats completed, so that the troops,
together with thirty-three batteries of artillery, had crossed in the darkness
and begun their attack at an unexpectedly early hour. There was
no great difficulty connected with the transit of Red Cross conveyances.
As we advanced towards Champigny, appearances betokened continued
success on the part of the French; and although wounded men were
being carried to the rear in great numbers, the general impression was
that the endeavours of our citizen forces against their enemies were on
this occasion attended by success. Thus matters continued during the
next two hours; our establishments moving little by little onwards,
following as we then considered the victorious progress of those with
whom our sympathies naturally were. The fight now raged with great
fury, its scene covering a vast extent of ground, the ridges that stretch
from Brie to Champigny, and beyond the latter place still further to our
right, presenting an almost uninterrupted line of batteries from which
the deadly missiles fell thickly upon the troops engaged, and upon the
ground occupied by us, while from the forts in rear of us similar showers
of projectiles directed against those positions whizzed over our heads.
Now there came a pause; brancardiers carrying wounded, and conveyances
of sorts similarly laden, came from the front, and continued
their journey rearward. There is confusion. The range of some
of the enemy’s guns has changed; so has the line of fire. Shells
fall more and more near to us; Spahis gallop in an irregular way
among us. There is confusion among the ambulance conveyances;
brancardiers are unable to discover those to which they respectively
belong. For the time being means are unavailable for the removal
from the field of men who had fallen wounded. After a short
time there was a rally. Again it was evident that the French were
attacking the German positions; but ere night closed in they were
everywhere repulsed. It was during the state of confusion just described
that the commander of the 4th Zouaves, having received what
proved to be his death-wound, was dropped and so left by the men
who had brought him so far from the front. A shell had burst in their
close vicinity. They abandoned the unfortunate officer, helpless as he<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_264" id="Page_264">264</a></span>
was, and themselves disappeared in the general confusion. Some few
of us expressed indignation in no doubtful terms. We rallied to the
aid of the dying man, to whom we gave such aid as we were able to
<span class="locked">render.<a name="FNanchor_301" id="FNanchor_301" href="#Footnote_301" class="fnanchor">301</a></span> A gentleman connected with one of the Embassies who was
present succeeded in finding his brougham; in it was placed our
patient, and so we started back to Paris for further help. Having recrossed
the Marne, we were driven by the road traversing the Parc de
Vincennes, and so entered the city by the Place du Trone. Denser and
more dense became the crowd as we neared the city; people in uniform
and in bourgeois dress, waggons, and troops in disorder, all served to
impede our progress. When near enough to the bulwarks to observe
what was taking place upon the slopes connected with them, a scene of
the most astounding character presented itself. Crowds of people,
male and female, were there, indulging in games as if the occasion were
a holiday; and yet within a very short distance from them their brothers
and other relations were engaged in deadly combat, torn and mangled,
in many instances, into shapeless masses of humanity. Having entered
the city, we were driven quickly to the American ambulance, and there
within a few short hours the sufferings of the poor <i xml:lang="fr" lang="fr">Chéf de Battalion</i>
had ceased. He entered his rest.</p>

<p>Before we could regain the field of battle, darkness had set in. Firing
had much diminished, though still proceeding heavily, the flames from
guns and burning buildings around us lighting up from time to time
portions of the plain on which the events of the day had taken place.
A considerable number of Red Cross men had returned in the hope of
succouring such of the wounded as were left on the ground. Bitterly
cold was the night, as hour after hour, till well past midnight, all of
us, with lamp in hand, and in small separate bodies pursued our search,
our own frames benumbed, unsupported by sufficient food, and without
the possibility of obtaining such comfort as hot coffee or tea could
afford. While so engaged, to our surprise, there flashed over us from the
Faisanderie a beam of bright white light. For a moment it illumined
the Prussian position upon the heights of Villiers, then suddenly ceased.
A shell flew through the air. There was a loud explosion, preceded by
a blaze of flame. We were made aware that for the first time the
electric light was made use of in this way. At last, wearied, tired,
exhausted by cold, we were able in the early hours of morning to reach
our respective hotels.</p>

<p class="drop-cap3"><span class="smcap1">From</span> early morning, and all next <span class="locked">day,<a name="FNanchor_302" id="FNanchor_302" href="#Footnote_302" class="fnanchor">302</a></span> ambulance equipages and
men patrolled the field of battle in the performance of their merciful
work, their search for wounded made difficult by the dense
fog prevailing. Hostilities had ceased for the time, to permit of interment
of the dead, and succour to the wounded. But unhappily the
truce was taken advantage of by stragglers of many kinds, some of whom
were bent on plunder. Everywhere on and near the scene of recent
combat there was devastation; houses burnt and otherwise dilapidated;
boundary walls reduced to fragments; trees broken and torn by shot;
the ground furrowed by shells. Bivouacking in the open, or in small
groups taking advantage of such shelter as remained against the bitterly
cold wind, were soldiers, who, after the fight of yesterday, so spent the
night where they had fought; more than half benumbed by cold, they
kept up camp fires by means of fragments of furniture, some of great
value, taken from neighbouring ruins. Their cooking utensils were
supplied for the occasion by <i xml:lang="fr" lang="fr">viande</i> freshly cut from horses killed by
Prussian shells. The carriages were soon filled with wounded. They
were driven back to Paris, their loads appropriately disposed of; after
which a second trip was made to the field, the carriages again filled,
the wounded in them similarly distributed, the horses getting over more
than thirty-six miles in the double journey. Rumours spread that in
some few instances the rôle of the Red Cross had been departed from;
intrenching tools conveyed in carriages bearing that emblem; information
interchanged between contending forces, communication of
which was beyond its proper sphere. The rumours applied to the one
side as to the other.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_266" id="Page_266">266</a></span>
Throughout the dreary night that followed, the French troops had to
remain in bivouac among the scenes and wreck of battle, their physical
strength, already lowered by privation, still further reduced by fatigue
and cold, for the weather was now bitterly cold; their <i>morale</i> impaired
by the scenes around them, added to the experiences of the previous day.
As subsequently learned, conditions of the German troops were very
different. All who had survived on the 30th were withdrawn from the
field of battle and positions near it, their places taken by others who
had not seen the carnage of that day, well fed, comfortably sheltered,
and thus, in physical condition as in <i>morale</i>, better fitted than their
opponents to renew the combat. At break of day on December 2
a furious onslaught was made by them upon the French, hundreds
of whom were so benumbed by cold as to be unable to stand to their
arms. No wonder, therefore, that to them the day became one of
disaster. During all that day wounded in great numbers arrived from
the field in Paris, all available accommodation for them became
crowded. Eminent surgeons were busy in the performance of needful
operations among the five thousand six hundred so brought to them.
As to the dead, their probable numbers did not transpire; but at one
point of the extensive range over which the fight extended, eight hundred
were interred in one long trench. During the succeeding night the
troops recrossed the Marne and bivouacked in the Bois de Vincennes.</p>

<p>The most determined effort yet made to break the besieging circle
having failed, the fact was now apparent that unless aid came from the
provinces, all within the beleaguered city were about to enter upon a
condition of things more desperate than we had as yet experienced.
On the day immediately following what undoubtedly was a withdrawal
from the field of combat, the aspect of Paris and of its people was that
of sadness, mourning, and uncertainty. The day was cold, a thick fog
overhung the city, with occasional falls of snow. Along the great
thoroughfares the usual traffic was replaced to a great extent by conveyances
engaged in the transport of wounded; funeral processions, more
or less imposing in their surroundings, met with in different parts of the
city. The absence of sound of heavy guns in the early part of the day
seemed to add to the sombreness of our conditions. It was in a manner
a “relief,” as afternoon advanced, to hear the familiar boom from outlying
forts, as their guns opened fire upon the German positions in front
of them.</p>

<p>A week of sadness passed; Paris “dead”; its shroud a thick covering
of snow; not a wheeled carriage in the streets; scarcely a foot-passenger
to be seen. Winter more than usually severe was upon us;
even the more unsettled classes of the populace seemed to give a<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_267" id="Page_267">267</a></span>
thought to the seriousness of conditions present, and more particularly
to those of the near future. As time advanced, so did the prevailing
miseries among the besieged increase and assume different forms; in
some disease and death, in others starvation in respect to food and fuel,
insufficient clothing, want of necessary care and attendants among the
poorer classes, and so on. As a result of exhausted fuel supplies, the
streets were dimly lighted by oil or petroleum lamps; shops closed at
nightfall; in streets and boulevards pedestrians had to grope their way
along the distance that intervened between the flickering lamps. Meanwhile,
by day and night, with hardly an interruption, the sound of
heavy cannonading was heard with suggestive distinctness. An occasional
hope expressed that help from the provinces would soon arrive,
only to be destroyed by the receipt by pigeon post of news of defeat
near <span class="locked">Orleans.<a name="FNanchor_303" id="FNanchor_303" href="#Footnote_303" class="fnanchor">303</a></span> Riot and a spirit of upheaval became manifest; the
places where “demonstrations” by the dangerous classes were most
pronounced, the Halles Centrales, and others where food was issued.
Within the churches scenes of a different kind were enacted: some
were nearly filled with men, women, and youths engaged in private
devotion; in others were groups in the midst of which the Service for
the Dead was being performed over a more or less richly draped coffin,
according to the social position of him or her whose body it enclosed.</p>

<p>Now it was that noble efforts were made by individuals, municipalities,
and by the Assistance Publique to lessen, as far as that was
possible, some of the greatest straits prevailing among particular classes.
Large sums of money were presented to the Paris Administration for
that purpose by some wealthy residents, of whom Sir Richard Wallace
gave 80,000 francs. Places of distribution of such fuel as could be
procured, and of food to the poor, were arranged; nor was it long
before the discovery was made that the persons who obtained the lion’s
share in these respects were the most clamorous and dangerous, rather
than the most necessitous for whom those measures of philanthropy
were intended. But among all classes, notwithstanding everything
possible in the way of help, the difficulties and privations incidental
to our position increased apace.</p>

<p>In the ranks of the citizen “soldiers,” more especially those of Belleville,
disaffection and insubordination took various new developments.
They established among themselves a so-called Committee of Administration,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_268" id="Page_268">268</a></span>
by which all orders were thenceforward to be issued, and
promotions made. They once more clamoured to be sent to the front
against the enemy; their demand was acceded to; their conduct when
face to face with their opponents so objectionable in more respects than
one that they were hastily recalled. The particular corps most implicated
were disbanded; a general reorganization, as far as practicable,
applied to the whole body of the Garde Nationale.</p>

<p>A possible significance in respect to other forces than those of Paris
under similar complications of circumstances attached to the occurrences
just mentioned; it was emphasized by conditions pertaining to
other classes of citizen soldiers whose reputation stood higher than that
alluded to. It was said of those enrolled under such titles as <i xml:lang="fr" lang="fr">Amis de
France</i>, <i xml:lang="fr" lang="fr">Francs Tireurs</i>, and so on, that so far from being recognised by
the Germans as soldiers, properly so called, when they fell into the hands
of the latter they were looked upon as brigands and assassins; dealt
with accordingly, that is, taken to the rear and shot. It was said of
them that “if the franc tireurs will indulge in Red Indian warfare,
they must take the consequences.”</p>

<p>The spy mania acquired renewed activity, experiences among us
foreigners becoming again unpleasant, though never to the extent
already mentioned. Such was the degree to which the new development
prevailed that certain aristocratic ladies who had taken upon
themselves the part of <i xml:lang="fr" lang="fr">vivandières</i>, in place of those to whom allusion
has already been made, were subjected to unpleasantness as a result
of suspicion that fell upon them. Houses in the windows of which
lights were detected in the course of the long nights of midwinter were
disagreeably overhauled by order of “the authorities”; those occupied
by Germans, or by French suspected of German proclivities, were in
some instances invaded by roughs, and that without interference by the
police, who were passive spectators of violence done to person or
property, or both. It was necessary for all who desired some measure
of individual safety to obtain at the office of the Governor a “<i xml:lang="fr" lang="fr">Laissez
passer</i>,” and to have the card so named viséd from time to time at the
same bureau.</p>

<p>Arising out of what seemed to us outsiders a very silly quarrel in
connection with the tittle-tattle and can-cans of a club a duel took
place, while the circumstances around us were as have just been described.
The principals and their “friends,” all French, every endeavour
made by the latter to prevent the encounter having failed, the
meeting took place in a garden within the city. The adversaries, each
with foil in hand, took their places as arranged by their “friends,” the
foils of the latter held so as to be under those of their respective<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_269" id="Page_269">269</a></span>
opponents, and so, ready to strike up the weapon in case of “accident,”
undue advantage, or other sufficient cause. Stripped to the shirt, the
combatants lunge, parry, and thrust at each other in the grey mist of
morning, while the sound of heavy firing from outlying forts was borne
through the air. From their persons perspiration issues, to be converted
by the cold of a December morning into visible vapour; the shirt of
one is pierced, his side grazed; the fight lasts forty-five minutes; the
bared arm of the other principal is suddenly raised quivering in the
air, blood trickles. “<i xml:lang="fr" lang="fr">Je suis touché!</i>” he exclaims; the weapon falls;
“honour” has been satisfied.</p>

<p>From forts and other positions around the city firing increases in
degree; it is continuous by day and throughout the night. Within, there
are large bodies of troops in motion to the sounds of drum and bugle;
orders issued that all gates of the fortifications shall be closed alike to
egress and ingress, these incidents being precursors of another attempt
against the enemy. Long before daybreak on December 21 the Rue
Lafayette was crowded by troops and ambulance establishments making
their way to the Porte de Pantin. Soon thereafter a combined <span class="locked">force,<a name="FNanchor_304" id="FNanchor_304" href="#Footnote_304" class="fnanchor">304</a></span>
comprising this and other portions, took up position on the open field,
triangular in form, at the angles of which stand respectively Aubervilliers,
Le Bourget, and Drancy. On the left of the French position the
combat immediately became terrific in its violence, the interchange of
fire from guns and rifles on each side amounting to a continuous roar
and shower of missiles. Heaviest of all was the bombardment of
Bourget, then in possession of the Germans, from the fort of Aubervilliers.
After a time the marine battalion, led by Admiral de la
Roncière, made a rush, hatchets in hand, cheering as they went, upon
the village, with the result that out of six hundred men, of whom their
force consisted when their charge began, two hundred and seventy-nine
lay dead or wounded within a few minutes, the position still retained
by the enemy. At other places also the French attack failed; a third
defeat had been sustained. The intensity of cold was the greatest
hitherto experienced.</p>

<p>While the fight was at its hottest a lady bearing the Red Cross
brassard came upon the scene, her precise object and purpose not
apparent. Wounded men were being brought to and attended by
members of ambulance societies under circumstances to which most
of us had become accustomed. Not so the lady, to whom the scene
around and its general accompaniments proved altogether “too much”;
her demeanour and style of action showed how unsuited she was to<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_270" id="Page_270">270</a></span>
the position into which, no one knew how or why, she had come. She
was taken in charge by a courteous surgeon, and guided with gentle
firmness to the rear, after which ambulance work proceeded with regularity
and system, as usual.</p>

<p>On the day following the scene presented by the battlefield was one
that fancy could have hardly pictured. The village of Drancy a mass
of ruin; fire and smoke everywhere rising therefrom; the church destroyed,
but in the midst of ruin the figure of the Madonna and Child
erect upon its pedestal and untouched. Parties of troops who had
bivouacked during the night sheltered themselves as best they could,
some by pieces of <i xml:lang="fr" lang="fr">tentes abri</i>, others by pieces of doors and furniture;
camp fires kept up by means of fragments of cabinets, costly
furniture, and pianos. Among the men some had possessed themselves
with sheep-skins, blankets, rugs, or carpets, with pieces of which their
heads and bodies were protected, giving to them a strange and wild
appearance. Everywhere the deeply frozen ground was torn by shells,
or had in it pits formed by the explosion of those missiles.</p>

<p>Accompanied by a Staff officer I visited two of the largest barracks
within the city, meeting in both of them from the soldiers through
whose rooms I passed such a display of civility and hospitality as I had
heretofore been unaccustomed to. In the Caserne de Papinière, in
accepting the cup of wine proffered by a soldier, I drank “Success to
the French army,” feeling as I did so how little likely was that sentiment
to be realized. From the further end of the room came the
inquiry, expressed in the English tongue, “How do you like our wine,
sir?” A brief talk with the speaker followed. In the course of it he
said he was by birth an Irishman; had left his wife in Dublin; had
served twenty years in the French navy; was well satisfied with that
service, in which there were a good many of his countrymen; that his
period for pension was very nearly complete; but in all that time he
had never been so near “losing his number” as “there at Bourget.”</p>

<p>Christmas is upon us. Weather bitterly cold; many of the troops
in bivouac suffer from frost-bite; the Seine thickly covered with ice;
fuel expended; pumping machinery, like other kinds, at a standstill,
hence water supply materially interfered with, personal ablution and
laundry work all but impossible. Marauding parties break down and
rob wood wherever they can; trees newly cut down are placed on the
hearth; they refuse to burn, but yield smoke in abundance, which
irritates and inflames the eyes. Food difficulties have increased in
urgency; the daily ration insufficient in quantity to maintain strength
and animal warmth. In the hospitals upwards of 20,000 sick and
wounded; mortality in those establishments greater than on the field<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_271" id="Page_271">271</a></span>
of battle; <i xml:lang="fr" lang="fr">pourriture</i> among the wounded prevailing to an alarming
<span class="locked">extent.<a name="FNanchor_305" id="FNanchor_305" href="#Footnote_305" class="fnanchor">305</a></span> The health of besieged had become impaired by semi-starvation;
hands, feet, and ears were chapped and painful. These
were among the conditions in which our great festival was celebrated;
affectionate thoughts wafted towards those from whom no communication
had reached us since the unhappy day of Chatillon.</p>

<p>Public opinion manifested itself in ways opposed to religion, law,
and order. Classes of people belonging to, or of similar type to those
of Belleville and Vilette, broke into ribaldry of expression that seemed
to approach in profanity that of 1792; in that also they were joined by
some of the daily papers, the position assumed by the Communists
so violent as to menace the existence of the Provisional Government.
Meantime there was increased activity in the batteries of the
besiegers, indicating that the circle of “fire and steel” beyond the city
had narrowed; yet, with all this, the dangers, present and prospective,
were looked upon as at least equal in gravity from enemies within as
from those beyond the walls.</p>

<p>On the 27th of December newly unmasked batteries opened heavy
fire on Avron and other places in its vicinity; shells began to fall
within the <i xml:lang="fr" lang="fr">enceinte</i> of the city, and so the long-expected bombardment
began. So heavy was the volume of fire on that position that during
three days of its continuance it was estimated that 7,000 missiles&mdash;&#8203;all
of large size&mdash;&#8203;fell upon it. Manfully for a time did the defenders stand
their ground; very great their losses in killed and wounded when at
last they were forced to abandon their forts on the north-eastern side,
their wounded serving to still further crowd the overcrowded ambulances.
The ultimate issue of the siege, never very doubtful to us
foreigners, had now become less so than before. Men asked each
other, “How is it that 600,000 Frenchmen permitted themselves to be
blockaded by 200,000 Germans?” The mystery seemed to be solved
by a <span class="locked">writer<a name="FNanchor_306" id="FNanchor_306" href="#Footnote_306" class="fnanchor">306</a></span> of that day, somewhat according to this manner: “It is
confessed that the Governor (Trochu) has shown unfortunate hesitations;
but to do good work the tools must be good, and in these
respects he is deficient. To fight the Prussians we should have old
soldiers, well disciplined and inured to war, reliable and instructed
officers; not young soldiers of three months, poorly fed and sickly, and
officers who have been too recently promoted to properly understand
their duties.” In gloom and sadness to us the year 1870 ended.</p>

<p class="drop-cap3"><span class="smcap1">Incessant</span> firing between the enemy’s positions and outlying
forts during the last night of 1870 and first day of 1871,
increasing in violence as the day advanced; additional batteries unmasked
on the German side, thus giving visible signs of what was to
come. At 3 a.m. on the 5th, the first shell of actual bombardment
fell within the city; then followed similar missiles in quick succession,
chiefly falling and exploding near the Panthéon, Luxembourg, and
market of Montrouge. In the course of that day a Government
Proclamation was issued, the terms of which as they are transcribed
seem almost childish in their simplicity: “The bombardment of Paris
has commenced. The enemy, not content with firing upon our forts,
hurls his projectiles upon our houses; threatens our hearths and our
families. His violence will redouble the resolution of the city, which
will fight and conquer. The defenders of the forts, exposed to incessant
firing, lose nought of their calmness, and know well how to
inflict terrible reprisals upon the assailants. The population of Paris
valiantly accept this new token. The enemy hopes to intimidate it;
he will only render its bound the more vigorous. It will show itself
worthy of the Army of the Loire, which has caused the enemy to
retire; of the Army of the North, which is marching to our <span class="locked">relief.<a name="FNanchor_307" id="FNanchor_307" href="#Footnote_307" class="fnanchor">307</a></span>
<i xml:lang="fr" lang="fr">Vive la France!</i> <i xml:lang="fr" lang="fr">Vive la République!</i>”</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_273" id="Page_273">273</a></span>
Bombardment increased in violence and rapidity during the nights
and days immediately following, the shells falling nearer and nearer to
the centre of the city. With reports of casualties among men, women,
and children, came accounts of buildings struck and penetrated by
shells, including private dwellings, hospitals, ambulances, churches,
and convents, all situated on the left side of the Seine. An exodus of
people from the places struck was a natural result. They flocked to
parts of the city situated on the right side of the river, and there, in the
face of great difficulties, were provided with accommodation; food
being obtained for them with even greater difficulty than accommodation.
Sick and wounded had similarly to be provided for; so had the
inmates of maternity establishments. Hotels, business establishments,
churches, and public buildings of all sorts were rapidly transformed for
the reception of the several classes alluded to; private houses belonging
to persons who had quitted the beleaguered city were “requisitioned”
for the same purpose, while in many instances private families gave
shelter and aid to refugees from the bombarded quarters.</p>

<p>Then opened upon the city what speedily became known among us
as “the terrible battery of Meudon,” on account of the great violence
of bombardment by it; the missiles therefrom committed greater havoc
than anything previously experienced, and fell nearer and nearer to the
centre of Paris as “practice” went on. Day and night continuously,
with varying intensity, but always greatest during the night, did the bombardment
continue. Answering fire from the forts around was scarcely
less actively directed upon the German positions, the incessant rolling
sound of heavy guns varied by that of exploding shells, the tremor of
houses so caused rendered the hours of darkness somewhat “hideous.”</p>

<p>So passed twelve days and nights. On the 17th of January there
was a slackening of fire from the forts. Rumour in different shapes
spread in regard to the cause: that to which most ready belief was
given being that ammunition had begun to fail; the meaning of such a
report significant. At this time certain published records appeared
in which statistics of casualties purported to be given; those during the
first eight days of bombardment 51 killed and 138 wounded, the
damage to buildings unexpectedly small. Some of us set to work to
calculate arithmetically our individual chances of being struck, and
so made them out to be relatively little. Those chances would no
doubt have been materially increased had the intentions assigned to
the German artillery been carried out of discharging incendiary
bombs upon Paris&mdash;&#8203;an intention frustrated by order of the Emperor&mdash;&#8203;for
that dignity had recently been assumed by <span class="locked">him.<a name="FNanchor_308" id="FNanchor_308" href="#Footnote_308" class="fnanchor">308</a></span> Fortunately<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_274" id="Page_274">274</a></span>
for us not more than three out of every five <i>obuses</i> discharged upon
us exploded; whether as a result of defects in themselves or other
cause did not matter to us upon whom they were directed.</p>

<p>It was now that the terms of a telegram said to have been sent by
“King William to Queen Augusta” was everywhere exhibited in the
great thoroughfares. That message intimated that “the bombardment
of Paris proceeds satisfactorily, thank God.” The comments passed
with reference to it were at the time distinctly expressive, and no
wonder. But now, long years after the event, the question arises&mdash;&#8203;Was
such a telegram ever sent?</p>

<p>Meanwhile the conditions of the besieged, as already noticed, had
increased in severity. The season of mid-winter was of unusual inclemency;
sickness and mortality by disease had acquired alarming
rates, irrespective of casualties in battle; fuel was unobtainable, the
want of it a cause of increased suffering and illness. The best energies
of arrondissements, public institutions, and private individuals were
directed to the mitigation of these and other evils incidental to a
people besieged and under bombardment; but, alas! while the cause
remained, the ordinary effects could only be averted in a very small
degree, if in any.</p>

<p>It was under these circumstances that a renewed spirit of disaffection
towards the existing Government broke out violently among the classes
who were the chief recipients of help in various ways specially granted
to them by that Government, even to the relative neglect of those who,
equally needy, were less clamorous. There arose dissensions among the
sectional Representatives; distrust of, and ill-feeling towards, the foreign
residents on imaginary grounds that the latter carried on a system of
communication with the besiegers. Signs of disaffection and corruption
were manifest among the citizen soldiers, those signs giving peculiar
significance to the extravagant terms in which official orders made
mention of the services performed by them; for the facts were popularly
known that an attempted sortie on the 10th miscarried because information
regarding it had reached the enemy; that a second, planned for
the 14th, had to be abandoned on account of some of those citizen
“soldiers” having failed to be in their assigned positions at the
appointed time. So far as indications pointed, revolution and civil war
were imminent, while heavy bombardment by the enemy was still in
progress.</p>

<p>Meanwhile the ordinary routine of everyday life went on much
as if besiegers outside and various dangerous elements within our
gates were non-existent, with the difference that to more common
subjects of talk was added <i>obuses</i>, including probable size, distance at<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_275" id="Page_275">275</a></span>
which from the speaker, and places of their explosion, damage to
property and life caused thereby, and so on. As time went on the
bombardment became, to some degree, a substitute for the weather as
subject of first remark between acquaintances when meeting each
other for the day; for example: “The bombardment is rather lively
to-day,” or “it is rather slow.” People met at dinner, if that term can
be applied to the fare procurable. Walking became a necessity, for the
reason that the horses of omnibuses and other public conveyances had
been requisitioned for purposes of food; hence, those of us who had
duties to perform, experienced increasing difficulties in carrying them
out. But these conditions were not altogether unrelieved by an
incident having in it much of the ludicrous. An order was published
declaring that widows of “soldiers” of the Mobile and National
Guards should thenceforward be deemed entitled to pension, the
immediate result being a great outcrop of marriage ceremonies among
the classes concerned.</p>

<p>All ordinary supplies of <i xml:lang="fr" lang="fr">viande</i> had now become expended, the small
reserve store being retained for the sick and wounded. Animals of
all kinds, excluding the <span class="locked">carnivora,<a name="FNanchor_309" id="FNanchor_309" href="#Footnote_309" class="fnanchor">309</a></span> were requisitioned, their carcases
exposed for sale in boucheries, but only issued to persons provided
with the required <i xml:lang="fr" lang="fr">billet de rationnement</i> from the mairie of his arrondissement.
Supplies of grain were in like manner “requisitioned”
and issued under authority; armed sentries guarded retail establishments,
their services on various occasions required against rioters, as
already alluded to, from Belleville and Vilette. In the southern parts
of the city long queues of women were to be seen, each individual waiting
her turn to receive her “ration”; not a few of the elderly and weak
among them falling where they had stood, exhausted as their physical
powers were from cold and insufficient food. In some localities, more
especially near the Luxembourg, casualties among them occurred by the
explosion of Prussian shells. The daily “ration” for which they
scrambled consisted latterly of about ten ounces of bread, one ounce
of horseflesh, and a quarter litre of <i xml:lang="fr" lang="fr">vin ordinare</i>. The bread contained
1/8 flour, 4/8 <i>fecula</i> of potatoes, rice, peas and lentils, 1/8 of ground straw,
the remaining fraction made up of water and “sundry” materials.
Women of all social classes aided the <i>real</i> poor in every possible way,
and in other respects maintained the reputation of their sex in times of
danger and difficulty.</p>

<p>An improved and ingenious method by which news from the outer
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_276" id="Page_276">276</a></span>world could be brought within access to the ordinary people within the
city was now introduced, through the instrumentality, it was said, of the
<i>Times</i>. A series of advertisements addressed to individuals appeared
in that journal; these having been reduced at Tours to minimum
dimensions by photography, the sheet containing them was thence
transmitted by pigeon-post. On arrival within Paris the whole was
enlarged by means of the camera, after which the messages were copied
and dispatched to their several addresses. In this way a message
reached me from my beloved wife&mdash;&#8203;the first I had received for upwards
of four months&mdash;&#8203;it was, “Your family are well; most anxious about
you.” I fully appreciated the significance of these few words.</p>

<p>In respect to privations and risks, my individual experiences were
neither more nor less than those to which many others within the
bombarded city had perforce to submit. My stock of cash had become
exhausted; to all intents and purposes I was a pauper, only able to
obtain the requirements of life by giving to the <i xml:lang="fr" lang="fr">maitre d’hôtel</i> in which
I resided written authority to my London agents, that in the event of
my death they should pay all his claims upon me. I subsequently
learned that, in response to my urgent requests sent <i xml:lang="fr" lang="fr">par ballon monté</i>,
my wife had vainly endeavoured to have money transmitted to me,
until, having applied to the American Embassy in London, a remittance
was at once sent through that channel; in due time received by me
from Mr. Washbourne, and so my pecuniary obligations discharged.
As pressure in respect to food increased, I fear that on some few
occasions I partook of <i xml:lang="fr" lang="fr">bifteck de cheval</i>, and once,&mdash;&#8203;only once,&mdash;&#8203;of
<i xml:lang="fr" lang="fr">paté de chien</i>; but against both of these appetite rebelled, and
latterly I had to put up with the one salt herring with which I was
supplied as “meat rations” for three days. Prior to the complete
investment of the city, I had procured and hidden away such small
supplies as I could lay hands on, of anchovies, mushrooms, sailors’
biscuits, and oatmeal; the quantities of each were small, but such as
they were, they served their purpose.</p>

<p>All through the night of the 18th, large bodies of troops marched
silently towards positions previously assigned to them with reference to
coming events. The night was unusually dark; the streets presented
only glimering lamp-lights at distant intervals; the city enshrouded
in dense mist; beyond the gates the ground saturated with rain,
the roads by which the forces had to proceed encumbered with guns,
waggons, and other obstructive objects.</p>

<p>Daylight revealed to “all concerned” the Proclamation as follows,
not only published in the journals, but affixed to walls in various places,
namely: “Citizens, the enemy kills our wives and children, bombards<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_277" id="Page_277">277</a></span>
us night and day, covers with shells our hospitals. One cry, ‘To
Arms!’ has burst from every breast. Those who can shed their life’s
blood on the field of battle will march against the enemy; those who
remain, jealous of the honour of their brothers, will, if required, suffer
with calm endurance every sacrifice, as their proof of their devotion
to their country. Suffer and die if necessary, but conquer! <i xml:lang="fr" lang="fr">Vive la
République!</i>”</p>

<p>Three <i xml:lang="fr" lang="fr">Corps d’Armée</i>, comprising more than one hundred thousand
men, under the commands of Ducrot, Vinoy, and Bellemere, had
taken, or were in progress of taking up positions under cover of Mont
Valérien against the Prussian lines between Montretout and Bugeval,
the prevailing fog so dense that assigned routes could not be maintained;
several hours were thus lost. The French troops were consequently
worn out with fatigue; portions of them had not arrived in
position, among others considerable bodies of artillery, so that when
about 9 a.m. the fight began, they had not been consolidated. On
the other hand, the larger forces against whom they were led were
unfatigued by night march and other difficulties; they had passed
the night in relative quiet, had good and ample rations, and were in
full physical strength. With all these disadvantages the first onslaught
against the enemy’s positions at Montretout and Fouilleuse was
successful. Thence, toward the French right, the combat quickly
developed in fury; no fewer than five hundred cannon, including both
sides, were estimated as engaged in their deadly work, excluding those
of Mont Valérien, missiles from which whizzed above our heads in their
flight towards the German lines. On our side, shells from the latter
fell as it were from the zenith among the masses of advancing infantry,
making great gaps, as each successive cloud of débris from their explosions
cleared away. From Fouilleuse we were able to see the terrible
violence with which the fight now raged. There the Société Internationale
des Secours aux Blessés established a field ambulance; many
wounded received first aid, and thence were dispatched to “fixed”
establishments within the city. To reinforce the troops engaged, whose
losses were already very great, large bodies of men from those in
reserve marched laboriously towards the front. The ground was soaked
by rain, their progress slow and difficult, themselves weary, fatigued,
and physically weak. In their advance they came upon many carcases
of horses killed by German shells, some of the men falling out of their
ranks to cut from them slices of bleeding flesh; having secured them on
their backs, they resumed their places, and so onward towards the
enemy. Meanwhile, a horrible scene was taking place in close proximity
to the place where, mounted, I stood with a group of Staff officers.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_278" id="Page_278">278</a></span>
A private of the 119th regiment of the line shot the captain of his
company while their battalion was advancing, and torn by vertical fire
as already mentioned. Ducrot ordered the man to be put to death on
the spot. A party of his own regiment was at once detailed for the
purpose; by it he was taken aside&mdash;&#8203;not more than a few feet from the left
of the advancing column; he was seen to fall. A party of brancardiers
approached; they were warned off; one of the execution party levelled
his rifle and fired at him as he lay struggling on the ground; then
another; then a third, and now the unhappy man lies still in death.
We speculated among ourselves as to the circumstances that may have
led him to commit the crime so expiated.</p>

<p>As day advanced the thick mist of morning cleared away, revealing
the progress of battle and extent of field on which it raged. That the
French were more exposed than were the enemy was at once apparent;
yet, though suffering greatly by shot and shell from unseen batteries,
they stood their ground with obstinacy, inured as they had now
become to combat by their four months of experience. Later on, however,
hesitation is shown in their ranks; stragglers drop away; needlessly
large <span class="locked">numbers<a name="FNanchor_310" id="FNanchor_310" href="#Footnote_310" class="fnanchor">310</a></span> accompany to the rear their wounded comrades;
unsteadiness affects battalions; and now the sad spectacle is seen Of
one such body in flight down the declivity adjoining Montretout.
Officers make frantic efforts to rally their men; daylight fades in
gloom; soon night closes in, mist again covers the scene; firing from
both sides have ceased; all around is dark and silent.</p>

<p>In the darkness for hours did the ambulance men of various societies
traverse the field in pursuance of their work. As conveyances were in
progress towards the general rendezvous, confusion and crush increased,
as a combined result of darkness and an absence of regular roadways;
progress consequently so retarded that night was far advanced
when we reached the rampart gates, our conveyances <i xml:lang="fr" lang="fr">complet</i> with
wounded men. As on the first occasion, roadsides and avenues
within Port Maillot were crowded with people. Loud and anxious
inquiries for relatives and friends who had taken part in the recent
battle were frequent; frivolity in abeyance, as if experience had impressed
upon them the significance of combat against our besiegers.
That the result of the day had been disastrous to the French was
speedily realized. Next day the casualties among the forces engaged
were estimated at 1000 killed, the greater number by artillery fire;
the wounded as “very many.”</p>

<p>Meanwhile the work of bombarding Paris, scarcely if at all interfered<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_279" id="Page_279">279</a></span>
with by the incident of severe conflict just narrated, was increased
rather than diminished in its intensity; new batteries opened upon the
city, with <i xml:lang="fr" lang="fr">acharnement</i>, shells falling upon places hitherto untouched.
St. Denis was assailed, and underwent greater destruction in respect to
property and life than had been sustained by the capital itself. A rush
of people from that suburb took place, causing serious inconvenience
to those whose duty it was to provide them with accommodation and
food. All hopes of deliverance had become extinguished; negotiations
were accordingly opened with the German Chancellor in view to
an armistice being arranged. While they were in progress, bombardment
continued with its usual violence. Early in the night of the 26th
there was a sudden lull; a few minutes before midnight there was discharged
upon us a volley from all points of the circle, such as we had
never previously experienced; then followed stillness. Bombardment
had ceased; we knew that the Convention had been signed. For 130
days Paris had been besieged; during thirty, the advanced forts had
been bombarded; during twenty-one, the <span class="locked">city.<a name="FNanchor_311" id="FNanchor_311" href="#Footnote_311" class="fnanchor">311</a></span></p>

<p>Demonstrations by “the dangerous classes” of Belleville and
Vilette took place; their plea, the terms on which the armistice had
been concluded. The Hôtel de Ville was menaced by crowds of
excited men, gesticulating wildly as they shouted, “<i xml:lang="fr" lang="fr">Vive la Commune</i>!”
They are dispersed by force of arms; several of their numbers
killed, many more wounded. There is a flight towards the Mazas
prison; an entrance thereto is effected, some of the more noted of its
inmates released. A rush is made upon the small remaining food
stores of their arrondissements; they are broken into, their contents
distributed among the assailants. After a time these disturbances
are suppressed. Trochu has resigned his command; Vinoy is his
successor.</p>

<p>When on January 27, 1871, the morning papers published the
terms of amnesty, the fact was one of common knowledge that the
stock of food remaining was not equal to more than six or seven days’
“rations,” even according to the reduced scale to which the besieged
were at the time brought down; in fact, all were now at starvation
point as a result of gradually diminishing allowances of food. Next
day the Germans occupied Mont Valérien as the French troops marched
out of it. Some hours later appeared a proclamation by the Government<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_280" id="Page_280">280</a></span>
of the Defence announcing that “the Convention which terminates
the resistance of Paris will be signed in a few hours”; that
“we could not have prolonged the resistance without condemning to
certain death two millions of men, women, and children. Mortality has
increased threefold.” “We come out with all our honour,” the same
document said, “and with all our hopes, in spite of our present grief.”
In accordance with the terms agreed upon, the process began of disarming
the citizen soldiers, of whom groups along the thoroughfares showed
by their gloomy style and demeanour those pent-up feelings of disaffection
which were soon to break out in the horrors of the Commune.</p>

<p>The conditions to which Paris and its people had been reduced
were urgent. Severe cold, absolute want of fuel, the insufficient scale
of food to which all were officially limited, prevailing sickness and
mortality by disease, added to the recurring influx of wounded as a
result of desultory conflicts beyond the line of fortifications, combined
to render further resistance impossible.</p>

<p>All establishments set apart for the reception of wounded were overcrowded.
Not alone food, but appliances were insufficient in quantity
and kind. In many instances private families had received wounded
into their houses, and so crippled their own resources. The result of
the recent sortie and action at Montretout was an accession to the
numbers requiring care and accommodation of three to five thousand,
for actual statistics were unobtainable; professional and other attendants
were insufficient to meet the demands on their services; while, as
if still further to complicate matters, the Germans sent several hundred
wounded French into the city, and so lightened the work of their own
establishments.</p>

<p>In some ambulances such scenes were to be seen as French and
German wounded occupying adjoining beds; no longer “enemies,”
but helpless; unable to communicate with each other; many destined
to quit the place in death, for hospital diseases setting at defiance disinfection
and all other supposed preventive measures proved fatal to
a large proportion of patients within those establishments. A heavy
offensive odour, that of <i xml:lang="fr" lang="fr">pourriture</i>, pervades wards and corridors of
the buildings, extending to the streets or boulevards immediately adjoining.
In the mortuary of a large hospital the scene presented was
too horrible for detailed description.</p>

<p>The defence now ended had been carried on at a cost in human life
in respect to which reliable statistics were unobtainable. According to
one account, deaths on the field of battle and in ambulances amounted
among troops of the line and Mobiles to 50,000; to another to 63,000;
to a third to 73,000; neither estimate taking into account mortality by<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_281" id="Page_281">281</a></span>
disease and privation among the non-military inhabitants. On the
capitulation of Paris the troops who became prisoners of war numbered
about 180,000; the fortress guns “captured” by the enemy 1,500 field
pieces and 400 mitrailleuses; in addition the gunboats on the Seine,
locomotives, and rolling stock.</p>

<p>While making my round among the ambulances, I was somewhat
surprised to hear myself accosted by name by a wounded man who
occupied one of the beds past which I was moving. At once I entered
into conversation with him, naturally enough expressing sympathy for
him. He briefly informed me that he was in the 101st (British) Regiment,
and landed with that corps at Gosport on the occasion of its
first arrival in England from India; that he remembered me on duty
there; that having left the regiment he joined the Francs Tireurs of
Paris at the beginning of the siege; that fifty per cent. of his comrades
had perished by shot, disease, or at the hands of the Germans, into
which they may have fallen as prisoners; that he himself had not slept
in a bed for three months until brought to the ambulance wounded.
He was but one example of the material of which such volunteers were
composed, and a similar story to his could doubtless be told by many
others.</p>

<p>Under the circumstances to which we were now reduced, welcome
was the news that supplies of food sent to the besieged from England
and elsewhere had arrived in proximity of the outskirts; credit must
be accorded to the supreme officers of the investing force for the
rapidity with which those supplies were forwarded to the now starving
people within, so that on the last day of January many waggon loads
were received, and forthwith distributed. On that day also postal
communication with the outer world was re-established, though with
the proviso that letters dispatched should be unsealed.</p>

<span class="subhead"><i>1871. FEBRUARY. PARIS AFTER CAPITULATION</i></span></h2>

<blockquote>

<p>Food in abundance&mdash;&#8203;Theatrical parody&mdash;&#8203;Contrasted conditions&mdash;&#8203;Preparations for
German entry&mdash;&#8203;Causes assigned for defeat&mdash;&#8203;Citizen and regular soldiers&mdash;&#8203;Distributing
food.</p></blockquote>

<p class="drop-cap4"><span class="smcap1">Renewed</span> disturbances inaugurated the month of February.
The central market, in which were the food stores arriving from
without, was again attacked and pillaged; nor were the rioters dispersed
until a strong military force arrived on the spot. Further supplies
came pouring into the city, until within a few days there was abundance
everywhere; all restrictions on sale removed; restaurants recovered
much of their ordinary aspect. From London came large quantities of
food, and of appliances for wounded; a donation from the city to the
Municipality of Paris. The whole of those supplies, in accordance
with such terms, were divided among the twenty arrondissements of
Paris, with the result that a large share fell to the dangerous classes
so often alluded to; comparatively little to the professional and other
respectable classes who all through the times of greatest trial had borne
their privations in silence. Within a few days thereafter, so profuse
had been the supplies issued that large quantities, exposed for sale in
shops, could be purchased at less than their ordinary retail price. But
money wherewith to make purchases had not yet come into the hands
of those most in want.</p>

<p>The urgency of conditions among the “better” classes alluded to
was known to those of us who had passed through the difficulties of
the siege now at an end; proffered suggestions in regard to issuing
food and other requirement to them were ignored by those in charge.
Thus came about the undesirable state of things that the disaffected
and dangerous among the population had more than they could make
use of; the orderly and reputable obtained little, if anything, to relieve
their necessities. An Englishman applied at the mairie of the 9th<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_283" id="Page_283">283</a></span>
Arrondissement for help in food from the <i>don anglais</i> received. He
was asked, “Are you really much in want to-day?” “Very much,”
was his reply, “or else I should not have wasted the day by coming
here.” So they gave him a halfpenny biscuit, a square inch of cheese,
and three lumps of sugar, but not until he had been kept waiting
several hours! That is but one illustration.</p>

<p>While on the one side the scenes just mentioned were in progress
as an outcome of well-meant liberality on the part of our own country,
others were to be seen, the style of which presented to us foreigners a
phase of Parisian characteristics altogether new. In a theatre close to
the Porte St. Martin, the privations and various other painful incidents
of the siege were parodied much to the apparent amusement of the
crowded house. Comment on the “performances” in question is best
omitted.</p>

<p>Fugitives who had abandoned their houses while investment of the
city was incomplete returned in daily increasing numbers, to find for
the most part that stores of food and wine they had left behind were
non-existent, they having been taken possession of meanwhile. Railway
passenger traffic was resumed; on the Seine the <i xml:lang="fr" lang="fr">bateaux mouches</i>
conveyed crowds of sightseers to the various river stations, near which
the most interesting relics of the siege might be seen, including dismantled
forts, dilapidated houses, devastated grounds, and burial places
of victims of the war. For the payment of the indemnity to the
Germans in accordance with terms of Convention it became necessary
to raise a special loan. No sooner were the <span class="locked">terms<a name="FNanchor_312" id="FNanchor_312" href="#Footnote_312" class="fnanchor">312</a></span> of that Convention
published than the people took it up with enthusiasm; from morning
till night queues of intending <span class="locked">subscribers,<a name="FNanchor_313" id="FNanchor_313" href="#Footnote_313" class="fnanchor">313</a></span> from sums of a few francs
to thousands, occupied the pavements in the vicinity of the offices
where their contributions were to be received. Nothing could better
indicate the frugality of the Parisian masses in respect to available
money than the fact that a sufficient sum was thus quickly and readily
obtained to enable the municipality to pay to the German authorities
at Versailles the first moiety&mdash;&#8203;namely, one hundred millions of francs&mdash;&#8203;of
that indemnity. Return to the ordinary conditions of the capital
went on; shops were re-opened; the windows made gay with merchandise;<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_284" id="Page_284">284</a></span>
gas re-lighted in the thoroughfares at night. Supplies of
provisions and of money in large sums, sent from various sources, continued
to arrive, one noteworthy contribution of the latter kind being
112,000 francs from Mexico. The process of disarming the troops was
still in progress, until the numbers should be reached in accordance
with the preliminaries already determined. The Government of the
Defence gave place to the National Assembly. The armistice was extended,
first from the 19th to 24th of February, then from the latter date
to March 12, the Treaty of Peace being signed on 26th of that first
named. Part of that Convention was that German troops should enter
Paris, and occupy part of the capital until the ratification of the Treaty
by the Assembly. Great excitement and threatened outbreak among
the lower orders was the immediate result, while the papers of the day
fanned rather than moderated popular ill-feeling by rhodomontade and
calumnies in their columns.</p>

<p>Preparatory to the entrance of the German forces, it was determined
that those of Paris should occupy quarters for the time being on the
left side of the Seine; that the duty of maintaining order should be
confided to the Garde Nationale. The citizen soldiers “magnanimously”
offered to take charge of the artillery guns, for the removal
of which horses were non-existent; the whole were collected and
“parked” in the Parc de Monceau, though at the time questions arose
as to the means by which they were again to be got from the hands
of those to whom they had so fallen. Signs of probable disturbance
multiplied apace; barricades were erected in some of the principal
thoroughfares; fights occurred between the most violent elements of
the populace and the Garde Nationale, with the result that some of the
guns were taken possession of by the former.</p>

<p>Brought in contact with representatives of various classes of society,
political and religious opinion, opportunity was afforded me to note
the views expressed by them respectively as to the causes to which the
present humiliation of Paris and of France was considered to be due.
It was my custom to record the several opinions expressed in conversation
as soon as I had an opportunity of doing so. I reproduce them
as follows, rather than in a classified order, <span class="locked">namely:&mdash;</span></p>

<p>1. The empire was looked upon as “expended.”</p>

<p>2. The manhood of Paris and of France had become degenerated in
physique; the sick and the relatively weak having been alone left after
the wars of the 1st Napoleon to propagate their kind.</p>

<p>3. The study of the military sciences had been neglected; officers
underwent examination rather for the purpose of obtaining appointments
than to attain proficiency in knowledge of their profession.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_285" id="Page_285">285</a></span>
4. Defects in administration by the Intendance, and general obstructiveness
in that branch of the service.</p>

<p>5. Over-centralization, so that when emergency of war occurred, no
corps was complete in itself; <i>materiel</i> had to be obtained from Paris,
means of transport and roads being at once blocked in consequence.</p>

<p>6. The soldiers being allowed to give their votes at elections, their
sympathies were diverted to their political parties rather than with their
military commanders.</p>

<p>7. Want of mutual confidence between officers from the highest to
the lowest rank; between officers and their men, and between the men
<span class="locked">themselves.<a name="FNanchor_314" id="FNanchor_314" href="#Footnote_314" class="fnanchor">314</a></span> In fact, general mistrust prevails where confidence should
exist.</p>

<p>8. The officers to a great extent being members of the same class of
society to which the rank and file belong, there is an absence of that
deference towards them by the latter, such as is considered essential
to the maintenance of the highest order of discipline. From this and
other circumstances there was said to exist a deplorable state of indiscipline,
of which indeed some striking illustrations occurred during the
siege.</p>

<p>9. Laxity of discipline among the higher officers, due to the (assigned)
circumstance that the deposed Emperor manifested hesitancy and uncertainty
with regard to punishments for shortcomings and offences on
their part.</p>

<p>10. A spirit of impatience of control and of opposition against
authority, fostered by the conditions of social life in France, including
the absence of domesticity, and, as a consequence, of lively affection
between parents and children, and among children themselves, many of
whom spend their early years among strangers.</p>

<p>11. The expenses connected with the unfortunate expedition to
Mexico had so far exceeded the estimate, that the Emperor “feared”
to make public the whole of the circumstances connected therewith;
hence it was considered necessary to divert to their liquidation money
obtained nominally for current military purposes. Thus it was asserted<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_286" id="Page_286">286</a></span>
the actual condition of military establishments differed from that represented
on paper.</p>

<p>12. A general lowering of the moral sense, of which the religious
sentiment is the first great principle.</p>

<p>To this somewhat imposing list I append the subjoined, which was
subsequently collated while perusing various works relative to the
Franco-Prussian war, <span class="locked">namely:&mdash;</span></p>

<p>(<i>a</i>) Absolute unpreparedness of a war, which was begun “with frivolity
without parallel.”</p>

<p>(<i>b</i>) General maladministration.</p>

<p>(<i>c</i>) Antagonism between the Paris and Provincial Governments.</p>

<p>(<i>d</i>) Misrepresentations of actual conditions contained in official
Proclamations and in organs of the Press.</p>

<p>(<i>e</i>) Political divisions and sub-divisions among the people, whether
official or non-official.</p>

<p>(<i>f</i>) Antagonism of interests and personal considerations among the
higher administrators and commanders.</p>

<p>(<i>g</i>) Disturbances fomented and brought about by agitators.</p>

<p>(<i>h</i>) The inferior military qualities of a large portion of the citizen-soldiers.</p>

<p>(<i>i</i>) Social immorality. For a long time past piety and moral earnestness
have been much shaken in French society; the cancer of frivolity
and immorality has eaten into the heart of the people.</p>

<p>That several of the defects above enumerated are real is beyond all
question, even when allowance is made for those which are perhaps
more theoretical than actual. Some had special reference to the episode
of the war from which France was about to emerge heavily
crippled; others have a prospective significance; nor is it easy to conceive
of success, so long as they are permitted to continue.</p>

<p>Adverting to the non-military qualities already mentioned, and to the
conduct in face of the enemy displayed by the extemporised citizen-soldiers,
to whom per force of circumstances the defence of Paris had
to a considerable extent to be confided, the fact is noteworthy and
suggestive that, having become to some extent acquainted with the use
of arms and with war, they became transformed into very dangerous
elements when the Commune was declared. It was then that they
fought resolutely against the Versailles forces, and committed many of
the atrocities by which that occasion was to be <span class="locked">disgraced.<a name="FNanchor_315" id="FNanchor_315" href="#Footnote_315" class="fnanchor">315</a></span> Of the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_287" id="Page_287">287</a></span>
troops belonging to the regular army, however, it is their due to observe
that in actual combat the gallantry displayed by them could not be
exceeded; no more could their patient endurance under the difficulties,
privations, and general hardships incidental to the siege. But individual
qualities were overbalanced by the disadvantages and evils just
enumerated.</p>

<p>No sooner had the gates of Paris been opened, under provision of
the armistice, than my <span class="locked">coadjutor<a name="FNanchor_316" id="FNanchor_316" href="#Footnote_316" class="fnanchor">316</a></span> with the Germans performed to me
the good and brotherly act of bringing for myself, and for distribution
among my friends and other persons whom I knew to be in necessitous
circumstances, not only liberal supplies of food, but also considerable
sums of money, contributed by charitable persons to me unknown. It
was a source of lively satisfaction to be able thus to aid individuals
and some institutions; and in the performance of that most pleasant
task several incidents occurred the recollection of which is still fresh.
A few examples must suffice. One lady, to whom I carried a fowl,
among other articles, was prostrate in bed, her physical powers reduced
by starvation to an extremely low ebb. When I told her that she was
simply dying from want of food, her reply was that she really had no
appetite; she did not think she could eat anything if she had it; yet
when I supplied her with some savoury morsels to be used at once,
and then the fowl to be cooked later on, her face brightened, she half
raised herself in bed, and clutched the little articles I had brought to
her. Another lady, to whom I presented some balls of butter, rolled
up separately in bits of newspaper, did not delay to unfold the packet,
but took a mouthful of the whole, including butter and paper. Being
informed that I had a few red herrings for distribution, she next day
drove to my hotel in her well-equipped carriage to receive <i>one</i><a name="FNanchor_317" id="FNanchor_317" href="#Footnote_317" class="fnanchor">317</a> of
those savoury fish. The “Little Sisters of the Poor” were astounded
and delighted to be presented with a small cartload of mutton, bread,
eggs, butter, and various other articles; for the aged paupers, to whose
care till death they devoted themselves, had been reduced to extreme
want, not a few having succumbed under their privations. In accordance
with invitation from the Lady Superior, I visited their establishment
to receive expressions of gratitude from its inmates, and in the
course of my visit was shown through a ward in the uppermost storey
into which a Prussian shell had penetrated, and where some of the
old, decrepid inmates had there and then died of fright. A Roman
Catholic Seminary sent a representative to express the thanks of its
inmates for supplies given to them. As I subsequently was informed,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_288" id="Page_288">288</a></span>
the nurses in an ambulance that I similarly aided danced round the
table on which the supplies were displayed, while they invoked blessings
on my head. Some British subjects to whom I was able to give
assistance in food and money were most grateful. As regards myself,
what I most craved for, and indulged in when opportunity offered, was
fried fat bacon and fruit, more especially apples.</p>

<p class="drop-cap3"><span class="smcap1">The</span> representative statues in the Place de la Concorde were
enshrouded; guards placed on either side of positions to
be occupied by the Germans. On the morning of March 1, the
head of a dense column of troops was seen approaching the Arc de
Triomphe; that monument passed, the “Army of Occupation” steadily
made its way downwards along the Champs Elysées. In front of all
rode a young officer, fair in complexion, his face pale, lips compressed,
expression grave and resolute; his name, as we subsequently learned,
Bershardy, lieutenant in the 14th Prussian Hussars. Some signs of
disturbance were shown among French onlookers; they were quickly
suppressed; all knew that the guns of Mont Valérien pointed towards
the city; that by them stood German gunners. All through the morning
troops <i>poured</i> in, until 30,000 men&mdash;&#8203;the number agreed upon&mdash;&#8203;were
within their assigned places; among them the Leib Regiment of
Bavaria, the losses of which in the war exceeded numerically its strength
when leaving Germany. It was now that the striking contrast in
physique, <i>tenue</i>, and discipline presented by the newly-arrived forces,
as compared with those to whom we had been so long accustomed,
was strikingly apparent to all spectators; doubtless to Parisians themselves.</p>

<p>Forty-eight hours, including one entire day, was the period mutually
agreed upon as that during which the German forces were to remain
within Paris. Precautions against collision between them and the
populace were so successfully taken that crowds looked on and quietly
listened to the foreign bands within their precincts. In other parts
of the city, however, signs of restiveness were visible. Among the
German troops, on the contrary, all was orderly and soldierlike. Early
on the morning of the 3rd, “evacuation” of the city began, and within<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_290" id="Page_290">290</a></span>
a few hours was completed. Not until the rear column had passed
the Arc de Triomphe did the mob, that meantime hung upon their
flanks, begin to “demonstrate”; a section of the withdrawing troops
faced round; the demonstrators fled helter-skelter. The work of sweeping
and burning refuse in the great thoroughfares was soon begun; it
continued during the day; by evening Paris looked as if it had not
been entered by a victorious army.</p>

<p>During the following night, internal troubles assumed the first definite
shape of that in which they were soon to culminate. The National
Guards withdrew from the Pare de Monceau some of the guns entrusted
to them, together with their equipment and ammunition, to arrange
them in order on Montmartre; others were taken to the disaffected
quarters, as Belleville and Vilette; while a definite plan of further action
was come to by the Communists. In the emergency so presented,
no apparent action was taken by the responsible authorities; citizen
“soldiers” were permitted to retain arms, the use of which they had
recently learned; with what result was speedily to be seen. During
the next few days scenes of pillage were enacted, wherever stores, of
whatever kind, existed; barricades were thrown up; other preparations,
in various ways, made alike for defence and offence. As events
developed, the commandant appointed to the National Guards was
repudiated by the men; they demanded that they should have the right
to elect their own commander and other officers. Battalions displayed
the red flag; marched to the Place de la Concorde; placed the emblem
of Revolution upon the statues there, and upon public monuments elsewhere.
On the 10th, as the Germans marched from Versailles, the
Communists placed on Montmartre the remaining guns, making a total
of 417. Seven days thereafter the horrors of the Commune began.</p>

<p>While the German army was entering Paris, I had the honour of being
entertained at a <i>déjeûner</i> by the members of the Ambulance de la
Presse, on the occasion of the distinction of Officier de la Légion
<span class="locked">d’Honneur<a name="FNanchor_318" id="FNanchor_318" href="#Footnote_318" class="fnanchor">318</a></span> being conferred upon me by the Provisional Government.
The venerable Professor Ricord was pleased to make me the subject of
a toast, alluding in kind terms to my association with the French army
and ambulances; then, taking from his own button-hole the rosette of
the Order so highly prized, he placed it in mine.</p>

<p>An excursion to a little distance beyond Montrouge revealed a sad
example of destruction: houses reduced to heaps of rubbish, with here
and there a fragment of cracked wall left standing among them; masses
of charred timbers; furniture and what had been ornamental pieces<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_291" id="Page_291">291</a></span>
strewn about in fragments among débris of various kinds, including dead
animals. From among ruined walls of gardens and conservatories
green young shoots of plants, revived by sunshine of early spring, served,
by contrast with the scene of destruction around, to impress us the
more. Were it possible for crowned heads of Europe to make a
similar round, it might ensure peace for one generation. So thought we
as we continued our walk through miles of devastation.</p>

<p>Making a journey to Versailles, the party of which I was one passed
by the heights beyond Meudon, on which were ranged the guns until
recently employed in bombarding Paris, but now parked preparatory to
being sent back to Germany. Several of them were seriously damaged;
others presented traces of work done by them in “the terrible battery,”
also visited by us; its condition, abandoned to ruin. Thence we looked
towards Vaugirard and vicinity, where greatest destruction by its shells
took place. At Versailles, while dining in the <i>grande salle</i> of the
Hôtel des Reservoirs, then filled with Prussian officers, we saw among
them Prince Leopold of Hohenzollern, the nomination of whom to the
Spanish throne was the ostensible cause of the needless war now ended.
Visiting in the Chateau the Galerie of Louis XIV., it was seen converted
into an ambulance ward, its paintings damaged and torn as a
result of wind and weather admitted through windows kept open for
purposes of ventilation. The less severely wounded had been dispatched
to Fatherland; those remaining were too seriously injured to
admit of being removed; in cots, above the heads of which stood canvas
representations of the “glories of France,” shattered frames of
recent conquerors lay in agony.</p>

<p>Under the wing of a <i>Times</i> correspondent, I witnessed on the heights
of Villiers a review by the German Emperor of three <i xml:lang="fr" lang="fr">corps d’armée</i>,
consisting respectively of Bavarians, Saxons, and Wurtembergers, all
under command of the Crown Prince of Prussia, As the troops took
positions assigned to them, it was observed by our friend, who had
accompanied them from Rhine to Seine, that their numbers scarcely
equalled half of those who entered France. An impression was said to
exist among the Bavarians that more frequently than other corps they
were so placed as to bear the first brunt of battle, and thus exposed to
more than was fair of risks in action. It was further said that considerations
of creed and politics had much to do with such an arrangement;
hence some fears were expressed lest unpleasantness might
now occur. All present, therefore, felt a sense of relief when, as the
Emperor, surrounded by his brilliant staff, rode on to the ground, a
cheer burst from all ranks assembled. The inspection over, the troops
marched off, the Crown Prince at their head. Next day the return to<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_292" id="Page_292">292</a></span>
Berlin began, the pride of victory no doubt saddened by memories of
thousands from among them, to be left buried in alien soil.</p>

<p>Being given an opportunity of testing railway arrangements for transport
homewards of German wounded, I embarked at Pantin station in
a train of that description. It was fully occupied by wounded men,
for whose requirements and comfort every arrangement was complete,
including staff and attendants. While in the train I was most
courteously and hospitably received by the staff. The journey taken
was somewhat long, nor did I get back to disturbed Paris till late at
night.</p>

<p>A visit to Montmartre enabled me to see the manner of disposal
and position of guns from the Parc de Monceau, now in hands of the
Garde Nationale, who have openly declared for the Commune. My
<span class="locked">companion<a name="FNanchor_319" id="FNanchor_319" href="#Footnote_319" class="fnanchor">319</a></span> and myself, recognised as foreigners, were courteously
escorted, first to one battery, then to another, comments meanwhile
freely made by those accompanying us in regard to their plan of action.
Still, as far as we were able to understand, no counter-measures were
taken by the authorities; and so the rising flood of revolution increased
in volume and power, to burst disastrously three days thereafter.</p>

<p>In obedience to orders I quitted Paris for England by evening train
on March 14. Early next morning I was with my beloved wife,
whose anxieties and fears during my absence had told upon her health.
So ended the important episode in which I had taken part.</p>

<p class="drop-cap3"><span class="smcap1">The</span> official Report of the mission performed had to be sent in,
that done, orders directed me to take over duty in the South-eastern
District, of which Dover is Headquarters. A few weeks elapsed,
when I received an order of readiness for India. For the first and
only time in my career I had to plead inability to proceed; long-continued
semi-starvation in Paris had so lowered physical strength that
reluctantly I was forced to plead the circumstance. The authorities
were pleased thereon to consider that episode equivalent to a tour of
foreign service; my name was placed at the bottom of the roster, and
so the next three years were spent at the favourite station of England.</p>

<p>All that time the quiet routine of duty was more of an agreeable occupation
than arduous or unpleasant work. Among some of the resident
families acts of civility towards myself and family were numerous;
intercourse with staff and regiments most pleasant, so that recollections
of place and people remain agreeable.</p>

<p>Military positions and Departmental establishments connected with
the ancient town itself had to be visited from time to time; so also had
several throughout the “district,” including Shorncliffe camp, whence had
proceeded in the early years of the century the force destined for Spain,
under command of Sir John Moore; Canterbury, with its associations
connected with St. Augustine; Maidstone, provincial capital of England’s
garden; Brighton, etc.</p>

<p>Gradually was the system of short service in the ranks of the Army
taking the place of that to which most officers of considerable standing
had been accustomed. Complications and friction occurred in such
a stage of transition among departments concerned in giving the change
effect. In the ranks themselves all was not propitious; the old class
of non-commissioned officers gave place to young and inexperienced,
whose authority, even when rightly exerted, was not always tacitly<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_294" id="Page_294">294</a></span>
accepted by the youthful and unbroken elements concerned. Moral
influence such as emanated in many instances from old and experienced
sergeants had all but died out; trivial shortcomings on the part of
young lads were magnified into “crimes”; more than ordinary difficulty
experienced by officers in keeping things smooth, yet “going.”</p>

<p>In matters of administrative routine difference of views between
officers concerned seemed inevitable; a satisfactory phase of official
life, however, was that in the few instances in which such divergence
occurred it was limited to official relations. Previous experience induced
me to formulate certain principles in accordance with which
correspondence submitted for decision should be dealt with; to them
I endeavoured to <span class="locked">adhere.<a name="FNanchor_320" id="FNanchor_320" href="#Footnote_320" class="fnanchor">320</a></span> Another point taught by experience was
that, in directing particular administrative ends to be attained, to leave
to officers concerned the details of means by which instructions were to
be carried into effect; in that way responsibility attached to the executive,
while at the same time it left to them freedom of action.</p>

<p>As a matter of history relating to an important episode, and some
personages connected therewith, it is worth while to refer to the
account of the famous ball in Brussels on June 15, 1815, related to me
by Lady de Ros, daughter of the Duke of Richmond, and who was
present on the occasion in question. How, while dancing and conviviality
proceeded, sounds of waggons and other heavy conveyances,
guns and tumbrils among them, broke upon the ears of the gay throng;
how small groups of the higher officers entered into grave and subdued
talk; how, without exciting notice, singly they slipped away; how in
the early hours of morning of the 16th, “the Duke” himself took his
departure; how, as the remaining guests left the room, the turmoil in
the streets of the Belgian capital resounded with the bray of bugles,
trumpets, and military <span class="locked">movements;<a name="FNanchor_321" id="FNanchor_321" href="#Footnote_321" class="fnanchor">321</a></span> and how, before the day was over,
several of those who had so left were brought back wounded, some
dead, from Quatre Bras.</p>

<p>[Subsequently, taking advantage of the sixty-one days’ leave to
which officers are entitled, I visited the house, now a convent, which<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_295" id="Page_295">295</a></span>
stands on the site of the ball-room just mentioned&mdash;&#8203;40&ndash;42, Rue de la
Blanchisserie.]</p>

<p>It was while at Dover that one of those sad bereavements befel my
dear wife and myself which leave their after-impress upon memory and
affection. The taste for sea life had been early developed in my
second son. As far as possible it was discouraged, but that having
failed, he was permitted to carry his wishes into effect. Alas! alas!
the result was very grievous. The ship in which he was proceeding
was ultimately “declared missing” at Lloyd’s; the dear, affectionate
boy was never heard of. It is too painful to write even this brief
notice.</p>

<p>A short visit by M. Henry Dunant gave me the opportunity of hearing
from his own lips the story of the Red Cross convention, of which
he has the distinction of being Founder. To his experiences gained
among the thousands of wounded left on the field in and near Solferino
without necessary help from the Austrians or Allies between whom that
most sanguinary battle was <span class="locked">fought,<a name="FNanchor_322" id="FNanchor_322" href="#Footnote_322" class="fnanchor">322</a></span> and afterwards in extemporized
ambulances for reception of those for whom provision could be made,
M. Dunant assigned his resolve to institute, if possible, an Association
whereby to mitigate in some measure at least the horrors of war such
as he then witnessed. Of medical officers and their work as seen by
him on that occasion he expressed himself in this way: “Certes, si
tuer les hommes est un titre de gloire, les guerir, et cela, souvent au peril
de sa vie, mérite bien l’estime et la reconnaissance.” But in numbers
they were altogether insufficient for the task required of them, supplemented
as they soon were by volunteers, not only from the countries
immediately concerned, but from others, including Belgium, Switzerland,
and even Canada. Bearing these matters in mind, he asked himself
the question, “Is it not possible to found through all the nations of
Europe societies the object of which shall be aid to the wounded in
times of war; that care the most prompt possible, not by mere mercenaries,
but by persons devoted by high principles to so high a vocation.”
His appeal, formulated in a most touching <span class="locked">narrative<a name="FNanchor_323" id="FNanchor_323" href="#Footnote_323" class="fnanchor">323</a></span> of what
he had seen in Lombardy, produced the effect desired by him; the
subject he had at heart was earnestly taken up by all classes of persons,
from crowned heads to peasants, and soon he had the reward of seeing
organizations according to his own model in active operation. It was
while he was occupied in observing the working of volunteer ambulances
in Paris that I had the pleasure of being introduced to M.
Dunant.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_296" id="Page_296">296</a></span>
At long last came the “gazette” of my promotion, and almost
simultaneously an order to take up at Aldershot the duties pertaining
to my new <span class="locked">rank.<a name="FNanchor_324" id="FNanchor_324" href="#Footnote_324" class="fnanchor">324</a></span> The chief event during my short stay at that
important military camp was the annual review and exercise of the
troops composing it. For some time previous the old system of
regimental hospitals and medical officers was in gradual process of
abolition, and now that destructive policy had been so far matured
as to be experimentally acted upon in the present manœuvres. My
own duty was limited to carrying into execution orders received.
But sympathies were altogether on the side of soldiers and their
officers, who raised their voices against it. By what was now called
the system of unification the fact became unpleasantly apparent that
thenceforward the sick soldier, together with his wife and child, must
depend in times of illness upon the aid of strangers, instead of, as
heretofore, obtaining the help of those who personally knew them,
and whose self-interest, even in the absence of higher motive, enhanced
the care and attention shown towards them.</p>

<p class="drop-cap4"><span class="smcap1">Suddenly</span>, and without note of warning, the contents of one of
those long blue War Office envelopes informed me that in consequence
of a death vacancy in India, I was to proceed without
delay to Madras. The immediate result was a good deal of inconvenience
and expense, arrangements having been made for a somewhat
longer stay in camp than under the circumstances was now possible.</p>

<p>Leaving Portsmouth by the Indian troopship <i>Euphrates</i> early in
September, in due time, and without adventure, <span class="locked">we<a name="FNanchor_325" id="FNanchor_325" href="#Footnote_325" class="fnanchor">325</a></span> landed at Bombay.
Arrived at the capital city of the Western Presidency, the hospitality of
one of India’s merchant <span class="locked">princes<a name="FNanchor_326" id="FNanchor_326" href="#Footnote_326" class="fnanchor">326</a></span> was extended to us, a letter of <span class="locked">introduction<a name="FNanchor_327" id="FNanchor_327" href="#Footnote_327" class="fnanchor">327</a></span>
having preceded us. It so happened that an unusually heavy
rainstorm had passed over that part of India a few days previous,
causing complete destruction of railways, besides much damage in other
respects. Our departure was accordingly delayed several days, it being
necessary that we should proceed by steamer towards our destination.
Meanwhile, however, the kind civility of our host was unrelaxed; short
trips were organized by him for our pleasure&mdash;&#8203;one to the famous
Caves of Elephanta on the island of Gharipuri, the sculptures in which
represent nearly, if not all, the mythology of Hindooism.</p>

<p>The first month of the “cold” season was well advanced, the cold
being rather in name than reality. Otherwise our sea trip along the
coast of Malabar was pleasant enough; the bold scenery of the western<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_298" id="Page_298">298</a></span>
ghats in some places striking, in others grand; the cities, towns, and
natural harbours, at several of which our ship made a brief stay to
land and take on board goods and passengers, became so many objects
of interest to us and a few others, who, like ourselves, had been also
forced to adopt this mode of travelling.</p>

<p>Arrived off Beypore, we disembarked; thence took train, and so in
due time reached Madras. The formality of reporting arrival to the
authorities concerned once got over, duty was entered upon, our residence
temporarily taken up in one of the large but otherwise comfortless
hotels with which the place was provided, all such establishments
being the property of, and managed by, natives.</p>

<p>Rumours circulated that a military expedition was likely to proceed
<i>via</i> Burmah towards Yunnan, to co-operate with a corresponding force
to be dispatched thither by the Yangtse kiang, with a view to inflict
punishment on those by whom Mr. Margery had recently been murdered
in that province. As a preliminary measure, the Commander-in-Chief,
Sir Frederick Haines, determined to make a tour through what
was then British Burmah, to satisfy himself in regard to the capabilities
of the country to meet requirements of an army, including food,
transport, supplies, and accommodation.</p>

<p>Together with other members of the staff with whom special details
relating to the expected expedition would rest, His Excellency and
party embarked; the pier on the occasion being crowded with his
numerous friends, a guard of honour, in accordance with his rank and
position, also drawn up. The <i>Oriental</i> quickly steamed away; in due
time touched at Coconada and Vizagapatam respectively, then away
across the Bay of Bengal, landing us safely at Rangoon on the seventh
day from that on which we had gone on board. Hospitable friends
awaited our landing, and by the kindness of Surgeon-General and Mrs.
Kendall I was made comfortable as their guest.</p>

<p>Various objects and places of interest in and around this modern
but prosperous city were visited and examined, so soon as relaxation
from official duties permitted us to do so; but it is not intended in these
notes to give more than a very brief record of experiences in these
<span class="locked">respects.<a name="FNanchor_328" id="FNanchor_328" href="#Footnote_328" class="fnanchor">328</a></span> The first to claim attention was the famous Golden Temple,
the Shoay Dagon, the most important Buddhistic memorial in Burmah,
originally erected, according to legend, as a monument over eight hairs
from the head of the Sage. In the course of our wanderings among
the many smaller temples by which the dagon proper is surrounded, we
met at intervals female devotees,&mdash;&#8203;nuns, in fact, who had given themselves
up to the service of the temple, their object in doing so, according<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_299" id="Page_299">299</a></span>
to our informant, that in the next transmigration they might be
born men!</p>

<p>In the course of the day’s excursion we came upon a very unroyal-looking
“palace,” now the residence of the Delhi Begum, and then
upon an equally unroyal-looking personage, described as the remaining
prince, his brothers having been shot by Hodson in 1857. The
residence of other political prisoners were pointed out to us, including
the house in which the deposed “Grand Mogul” of Delhi <span class="locked">died.<a name="FNanchor_329" id="FNanchor_329" href="#Footnote_329" class="fnanchor">329</a></span></p>

<p>The extent to which the Chinese element monopolized various kinds
of business and industry was remarkable; it was no less evident that
the best portion of the town was theirs. In course of our rounds we
met with several examples of what may in a sense be looked upon as a
new race; namely, fruits of unions between Chinese men and Burmese
women. Those with whom we met were young women, comely in appearance;
their costumes a happy mixture of styles of the nationalities
personified in themselves. It is probable that the males adopted the
costume pertaining to one or other nationality, and so were undistinguishable
from these.</p>

<p>Our journey upwards by steamer on the Irawaddy was pleasant, and
in some respects interesting. The early portion was through a succession
of narrow creeks before getting into the main stream, somewhat
after the manner of the Soonderbunds, but on a small scale as compared
to them. As we advanced, a rich, well-cultivated country opened
up on either side of us. The fresh cool air on deck made thick clothing
desirable. On either side well-to-do villages rose at short intervals as if
out of the river, while on it were thickly dotted boats of various sizes
transporting goods of many kinds. Rafts of timber, consisting of
several portions ingeniously united, and well steered, were met with
winding, as it were in folds, along the current. Fields of rice and
gardens of banana gave place to patches of forest, separated by tracts
covered by tall reed grass; then dense bamboo jungle, while from some
of the riverside villages odours wafted off which told that in them
various delicacies from fish, such as Burmans love, but other people
abominate, were in course of preparation. Such a place was Pantanau,
at which we spent a night.</p>

<p>Resuming our journey, the somewhat large towns of Yandoon and
Donabew were passed in quick succession, the latter associated with
the history of the first Burmese War, 1824&ndash;26. There, one of the
most severely contested battles of that war took place; the Burmese<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_300" id="Page_300">300</a></span>
leader, Bundoola, was killed. At the same place in the war of 1852
severe fighting took place, heavy losses being inflicted upon our forces
by the native troops under command of Myot Zoon.</p>

<p>In due time we are off Hansadah, also associated with the wars of
1825 and 1852; the name of the place itself&mdash;&#8203;namely, <i>Hansa</i>&mdash;&#8203;<i>anser</i>,
goose&mdash;&#8203;being derived from Turanian mythology. At a little distance
from that place a halt was made to replenish the stock of firewood;
the time so spent enabling us to take a short excursion in the near
vicinity. Animal life in great profusion existed everywhere; cattle in
excellent keeping, for the Burmese are extremely kind to them; poultry
of all sorts in abundance; sparrows in myriads, and if possible more
bold than are their kind in our own country; water birds in great
numbers; land birds equally so are everywhere, nor are they as yet
slaughtered in the name of “sport,” as doubtless they will be when
British guns become more numerous here than, luckily for the wild
creatures, they are at present.</p>

<p>On either side the country changes gradually in appearance; at first
an uninterrupted level, then undulating, the inequalities greater and
greater as we proceed. Now the dim outline of the Arracan Yoma
range looms in the distance; we reach the high bold promontory of
Akouk-tong, round the base of which the Irawaddy rushes violently.
On its river-face several rude carvings represent Buddha; on its
summit and landward declivity stand pagodas of various sizes, the
whole connected with each other by winding pathways. During the
war of 1852 the Burmese erected a powerful battery upon the
summit of that promontory, for the capture of which a party, under
command of Captain Gardener, was landed from the <i>Enterprise</i>. Unhappily
it fell into an ambuscade, its commander beheaded, his head
carried away as a trophy of victory. More and more distinctly the
hills of Prome came into view; forests of teak, interspersed with
patches of custard-apple trees, were seen clothing their sides, tracts of
underwood everywhere. Now we obtain glimpses of a well-made
military road, to be used if need be by troops from Akayab to this
place.</p>

<p>Prome is a city or town of considerable importance; its chief products,
lac, petroleum, silk, and lacquer. Occupying an elevated site
is “The Holy Hair Pagoda,” smaller in dimensions than its counterpart
the Shoay Dagon at Rangoon; like it, approached by an extensive
flight of steps, on either side of which is a long series of mythological
figures. A variety of bells, large and small, swung from stands, at
short intervals among the buildings connected with the temple proper.
These bells, when struck by a mallet of deer’s horn, suspended from their<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_301" id="Page_301">301</a></span>
stands for the purpose, emit a sound of surprising sweetness. In the
second Burmese War, namely that of 1852, Prome was taken possession
of by our troops on October 11.</p>

<p>Thyet Myo is reached after a few such mishaps as are incidental to
travel on the Irawaddy; among them breaks-down of machinery, leaking
of steam boilers, running “fast” upon sand-banks, getting doubled
up in the coils of rafts, and so on. As on the occasion of our departure
from Madras, so on disembarking here, a guard of honour, with
regimental band and colour, salutes the chief; hospitable <span class="locked">friends<a name="FNanchor_330" id="FNanchor_330" href="#Footnote_330" class="fnanchor">330</a></span> invite
us to their houses; our party is comfortably and well provided for.</p>

<p>Thyet Myo, otherwise “Mango city,” has a history which dates back
to <span class="smcap smaller">A.D.</span> 250. In 1854 cantonments for British troops were erected near
to it, on a site so situated as to command the passage of the Irawaddy.
In 1857 the river deserted its old bed, making for itself a new one at
least a mile and a half distant, thus destroying the purpose originally in
view.</p>

<p>A tedious ride through thorny jungle, then along what was intended
to become a main line of road to Mendoon, took us to a series of
petroleum wells at Pendouk-ben. Regarding them great expectations
were entertained, and energetic endeavours were in progress accordingly;
but so far, their produce was limited to the oozing in small
quantities of “oil” from the sides of wells in course of formation in
the schistoze rock. Subsequently, that industry, there and elsewhere in
the country, has attained great importance.</p>

<p>Official duties over at Thyet Myo, our journey was resumed, all
arrangements made beforehand for an expected interesting if somewhat
arduous progress through the extensive forest that occupies the tract of
territory between the rivers Irawaddy and Sitang, including what is
called “the great Yoma range” of mountains, or more properly speaking,
hills. Our first move was to cross the first-named river and encamp
on its further bank. Next morning, we <span class="locked">four<a name="FNanchor_331" id="FNanchor_331" href="#Footnote_331" class="fnanchor">331</a></span> began our real trip, all
mounted, the large body of “followers” of all sorts composing our escort
making their way on foot.</p>

<p>Our progress during the next four days was along “roads” the
roughness and other difficulties of which rapidly increased as we went
on; villages and patches of cultivation became smaller and less
frequent; the people showed themselves curious to see the <i>kalas</i>, or
white foreigners, their own state of raggedness and dirt offensive to
look upon.</p>

<p>We had reached the densest part of the forest, at a point whence our<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_302" id="Page_302">302</a></span>
further progress was to be by elephants, a track being made in the
jungle by a number of men sent before us for that purpose. We
reached a stockaded village, such a defence in this secluded spot being
very necessary against marauders. The forest resounds with the voices
of birds, from the resplendent plumage of some of which the sunlight
is reflected in flashes. Later on all becomes silence, save from the voices
of our own party, and so we reach, as afternoon advances, the halting
place of Mengee Sekan.</p>

<p>Hitherto we have taken advantage for accommodation overnight of
such buildings as we found, in the shape chiefly of deserted Buddhist
monasteries, in various stages of decay. It became necessary to
extemporize a hut or bower in which to pass the night. Such a place
was quickly prepared for us by natives attached to our party, who, by
means of their <i>dahs</i>&mdash;&#8203;half-knife, half-sword&mdash;&#8203;cut down branches of
bamboos and trees; these they arranged and secured by ropes made of
bark and creepers: thus they made quarters in which we were by no
means uncomfortable.</p>

<p>Our elephant steeds carry us onwards, along the half-dried bed of
what in the rainy season is a mountain torrent, confined on either side
by precipitous cliffs, our progress at times interrupted by deep pools,
at others by boulders singly or in masses in the river bed; these
obstacles having to be circumvented as best was practicable, but always
causing much delay and inconvenience. Coming upon a pathway,
evidently used by wandering Karens, and made passable for us by our
dah-men already mentioned, our elephants have to scramble as best
they can upwards along the steep face of a mountain spur of the
Yoma range. We gain the summit, and from it obtain a wide and
extensive view of rich dense forest stretching far away, around, below
the level of the point from which we took our survey. We pass the
watershed that divides the tributaries to the Irawaddy and Sitang.
Our descent is rough and precipitous; we arrive at the Kyat-Moung
creek, and for some miles travel eastward along its bed; the forest on
either side dense as before, the brushwood and lower vegetation consisting
chiefly of ferns and stemless palms. After a day of somewhat
arduous toil we reach an open space, and there a bower being quickly
prepared for us we rest for the night.</p>

<p>Our journey resumed, the roadway we take is once again the bed of
a mountain stream, the banks high and steep; vegetation still dense,
huge creepers stretching from branch to branch, masses of parasitical
plants hanging from the highest arms. Soon the forest becomes less
dense; isolated houses, then villages, surrounded by patches of cultivated
ground, are reached. Such a village is Pyagone. It is under the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_303" id="Page_303">303</a></span>
jurisdiction of Tonghoo, from which place letters have been sent for us,
and so we hear of those we care for. Here we part with our elephants
and other establishments belonging to Thyet Myo, exchanging the
former for small Burmese ponies, on which the remaining part of our
journey is performed. Several more marches were performed, differing
in no particular characteristic from those already alluded to. Then,
glittering in the sun, but still a long way in front of us, the pinnacle of
a gilded pagoda indicates the position of Tonghoo. As we plod along
the dusty way, we overtake a caravan of Shans, their bullocks laden
with merchandise to market. We reach the remains of what was once
the fortified wall by which the city was surrounded, but is now a series
of dilapidated fragments. <span class="locked">Friends<a name="FNanchor_332" id="FNanchor_332" href="#Footnote_332" class="fnanchor">332</a></span> come out to receive and offer us
hospitality; baths and good cheer soon set us up; we look back
amused at such small discomforts as we had recently undergone.</p>

<p>Tonghoo marks the eastern limit of what was, three centuries <span class="smcap smaller">B.C.</span>,
the empire of Asoka. The modern town, however, dates <i>only</i> from the
tenth century of our era; its position, upon a peninsula round which
winds the river Sitang. At a distance eastward, the Karenee range of
mountains some four thousand feet in height, their sides thickly covered
by forest; the general aspect of the locality and its surroundings forlorn
and unattractive.</p>

<p>At the time of our visit a political “complication” with the king of
Burmah was considered likely to be the outcome of a different interpretation
as to the boundary line between Native and British Burmah
entertained by the Indian and Burmese officials; while the Karens lay
claim, in opposition to both, to a tract of territory said to have been
occupied by them from time immemorial. Some months subsequently
this matter was amicably arranged.</p>

<p>Our duties performed, our homeward journey began; we start away
to Tantabin, where long, narrow boats lie moored to the bank, awaiting
to take us on board, and so down the Sitang River. But the hospitality
of friends at <span class="locked">Tonghoo<a name="FNanchor_333" id="FNanchor_333" href="#Footnote_333" class="fnanchor">333</a></span> has yet another demonstration to the Chief and
his party ere we finally take leave. A sumptuous and costly <i>déjeûner</i>
awaits us in the <i>zyat</i>, or travellers’ rest-house at the ghat. When the
meal is over and we get on board each his particular boat, many
expressions of mutual good-will exchanged, much waving of hands and
handkerchiefs, and then&mdash;&#8203;our river trip begins.</p>

<p>The kind of craft in which the next few days and nights must be
spent is peculiar. Mine consists of the scooped-out trunk of a tree,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_304" id="Page_304">304</a></span>
its inner arrangements fitted up according to Burmese ideas of comfort,
or it may be, luxury. The measurement of the boat, or rather canoe, is
three tons, itself so narrow and crank that practice is needed to move
without tilting it over to a dangerous degree; yet on further experience
this became sufficiently easy. The crew comprised six Burmese, active
in body, cheery in disposition, well acquainted with their particular
work; ready to joke and chaff with brother boatmen, as we glided
pleasantly down the stream.</p>

<p>A short halt is made at Shoay Gheen, an important town, at which
in due time we arrive. Here we find the remains of a stockade, held
in considerable strength against our troops by the Burmese in 1825,
though surrendered by them without a struggle in December of that
year. There are two respects in which Shoay Gheen is famous: the
one, that from here direct to Yunnan a trade route extends; the other,
that in the district to which the town gives its name is the chief
habitat of that most dreaded of poisonous snakes, the hamadryad
(<i>Ophiophagus elaps</i>).</p>

<p>Another day and night and we are at the town of Sitang; its streets
and houses are arranged in regular order, the streets wide, sheltered,
boulevard like, by a row of spreading trees on either side; everywhere
flocks of poultry, large and small, especially of the particular breeds for
which Burmah is famous. On the more prominent points are pagodas,
several undergoing repair and being regilded. Near each is a group of
hideous stucco figures of <i>nats</i>;<a name="FNanchor_334" id="FNanchor_334" href="#Footnote_334" class="fnanchor">334</a> among these, people in attitudes of
devotion, presenting to the images offerings, sprigs of sacred flowers,
jasmine and jonesia (the asoka tree), and other plants.</p>

<p>In the first Burmese War a strong position was taken up by them at
this place. On January 7, 1826, it was unsuccessfully attacked by
our forces, who sustained severe loss, including their commander; on
the 11th, however, the attack was renewed, the position captured, with
a loss to the enemy of six hundred in a strength of four thousand
defenders. In 1852, after peace had been declared, a British detachment
was stationed here, and so remained for some time.</p>

<p>Time presses; tide waits for no man. Our boatmen, aware of the
latter fact, press on by means of sail and paddle throughout the night;
we arrive at Kadouk soon after daylight. Considerably to our surprise,
our boats are quickly turned from the main stream into a narrow creek,
and there made fast. But the detention is only for a little; our boatmen
resume their work; our boats re-enter the stream, and for a time
keep close to the right bank. A rushing sound comes upon us from the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_305" id="Page_305">305</a></span>
distance; it increases; the tidal wave of the Sitang is upon us; not in
its full volume, however, for from a point just ahead of us it breaks with
a roar, and then, curling with foam as it advances, it rushes irresistibly
to the opposite bank. It was to avoid this “bore,” for so the wave
is named, and being probably swamped by its force, that our boatmen
had pushed on.</p>

<p>Communication between the Sitang and Pegu rivers was by means
of the Kyatsoo creek, and that only during the three days of spring
tides at the present season of the year. A canal was in progress of
construction, and railways were being extended in various directions;
yet neither was usable for our purpose. One suggestive circumstance,
however, we learn: that, anticipating enhanced value of land as a result
of such works, a precocious native agriculturist is making extensive
purchases along the line of the new waterway. Our passage along the
Kyatsoo creek was marked by nothing more stirring than a succession
of groundings, bumps against other craft, and such trifles. On either
side of us cultivated fields extend away to the distance; on some of
them the blue flower of the flax plant is bright and fresh. Isolated huts
and small villages occur at small distances from each other, and high
up in the azure firmament a lark pours forth its volume of song, as in
our own island.</p>

<p>As we proceed, the tapering summits of pagodas are seen reflecting
the sunlight ahead; they indicate the site of the once important city of
Pegu, capital of the Talain kingdom. A little further and we experience
the tide as it comes from the river so named, to meet that from
the Sitang, by which so far we have been conveyed. A little more
and we are back in Rangoon, the members of our small party hospitably
received by newly-made friends, Mr. and Mrs. Wilkinson kindly
taking me to their house.</p>

<p>The next few days were passed mostly in the performance of official
duties, spare intervals being taken up in visiting places of interest previously
passed over from want of time. Our journey and observations
made during it supplied subject alike for official and for ordinary talk,
giving zest to forecasts variously expressed in regard to the probable
issue of events which may follow upon the death or deposition of
the king. The prevailing view was that Government will place upon
the throne the legitimate heir, and having done so will carry on administration
by means of a Commission. In such an event, it is
anticipated that Burmah will be one of the best fields for British
energy and capital, that communication will be opened up, and
resources of the country developed.</p>

<p class="drop-cap3"><span class="smcap1">We</span> embark on the <i>Mecca</i>. A week passes; we land at Madras,
bearing with us pleasant recollections of friendly hospitality
received during our now bygone “Trip to <span class="locked">Burmah.”<a name="FNanchor_335" id="FNanchor_335" href="#Footnote_335" class="fnanchor">335</a></span></p>

<p>The death of Lord <span class="locked">Hobart,<a name="FNanchor_336" id="FNanchor_336" href="#Footnote_336" class="fnanchor">336</a></span> Governor of the Presidency, was an
event regretted by those of us who had come to know his amiable
though retiring character, and much sympathy was expressed towards
the widowed Lady Hobart on her bereavement. The remains of the
deceased were carried to the tomb with all the pomp and ceremony
due to the high office he had occupied, and estimation in which he was
generally held, the coffin committed to the tomb in St. Mary’s Church,
Fort St. George.</p>

<p>While clearing out a place for the purpose, the workmen came upon
the coffin of Lord Pigot, whose death took place in 1776, and whose
place of burial, if not intentionally concealed, had long since ceased to
be remembered. The story of his death was thus resuscitated, and
reference made to history relating how the Council deposed him, how
he was arrested by the Commander-in-Chief, placed in confinement,
and there forcibly kept during eight months, at the end of which he
died. No wonder that this audacious proceeding on the part of the
chief actors in the drama produced astonishment and indignation at
home.</p>

<p>An interregnum followed, during which the senior member of<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_307" id="Page_307">307</a></span>
<span class="locked">Council<a name="FNanchor_337" id="FNanchor_337" href="#Footnote_337" class="fnanchor">337</a></span> became head of the Government, the headquarters of which,
together with those of the Commander-in-Chief, were shortly thereafter
transferred to Ootacamund, where they remained until the following
“cold” season, as it is called in Madras.</p>

<p>In the latter part of the year arrived His Grace the Duke of Buckingham
and Chandos, appointed Governor. On the occasion of his
landing, together with his daughters, the three Ladies Grenville, there
was an immense gathering at the pier to receive the distinguished party.
The assemblage comprised His Excellency the Commander-in-Chief,
staff, high military officers, and heads of departments, a guard of
honour, Government and municipal officers, representatives of the native
princes and nobility, and, in addition, a large concourse of the <span class="locked">community.<a name="FNanchor_338" id="FNanchor_338" href="#Footnote_338" class="fnanchor">338</a></span></p>

<p>The arrival of the Prince of Wales was an important event in the
history of Madras. During the stay of His Royal Highness at the
provincial capital, the best endeavours of all classes, official and non-official,
natives and British, were directed to manifest duty and loyalty
to the Heir Apparent. In addition to official entertainments and
receptions given by Governor and Commander-in-Chief, the civil
society, native princes and community, did all they could to do honour
to him and to themselves on the occasion.</p>

<p>The next events of importance in reference to official affairs in
Madras comprised a change in the head of the Army, Sir Frederick
Haines being moved to Simla, and succeeded by Sir Neville Chamberlain.
The departure of the former was much regretted by all classes,
military, civil, and non-official; all honour and welcome were given to
the latter, whose great military reputation and high character were
known to and acknowledged by all.</p>

<p>In 1877 the Madras Presidency, as well as other parts of India, was
visited by famine, large numbers of natives falling victims, notwithstanding
the exertions by the Governor and officers acting under the
orders of His Grace to combat the misfortune. Private associations
and individuals added their endeavours to those by Government; missionary
bodies provided for large numbers of orphans and other victims,
with the result that many “converts” were added to their lists. The
necessity for extended and improved systems of irrigation being shown,
steps were taken in both directions. While not a few of the ancient
methods had been abandoned, the modern substitutes were, in some
instances, far from effectual for their purpose. Now also an important<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_308" id="Page_308">308</a></span>
financial measure was adopted: a special fund against famine was
established, the equivalent of eight million pounds sterling set aside for
that purpose, and if some time thereafter that fund was otherwise absorbed,
its original devisers and founders had passed from office before
the change in question took place.</p>

<p>In obedience to orders, I visited a camp situated a few miles from
the city of Madras for the reception and care of sufferers from the
famine, the object being the somewhat technical one of making a report
on the phenomena of starvation. In tents provided for their accommodation
lay prostrated men, women, and children in all stages of
absolute starvation. Carts were bringing in from the surrounding districts
persons who, while proceeding along the highways in search of
food and other aid, had fallen exhausted, and so lay on the roadsides.
Altogether, the sights presented were very sad.</p>

<p>There being a prospect that Ootacamund would shortly become the
permanent seat of the Presidency Government, His Grace the Governor
appointed a <span class="locked">Committee,<a name="FNanchor_339" id="FNanchor_339" href="#Footnote_339" class="fnanchor">339</a></span> of which I was senior member, to inquire into
and report upon the general condition of that place. The subject was
carefully gone into, the respects pointed out in which improvements
were suggested, the nature of those improvements given in detail. In
due time our report (written by me) was officially submitted; it passed
through the usual official channels, and, having done so, was <i>not</i> acted
upon. Years have passed away since then; the public prints record
that evils have occurred at this beautiful locality which, it is safe to
believe, would have been averted had our recommendations been
carried out; those evils, moreover, definitely predicted in that report.</p>

<p>Another subject on which it fell to my lot to submit a report, related
to the prevalence of fevers among our troops: a duty which caused
myself much unpleasantness, inasmuch that practical experience was
brought into somewhat violent collision with pure theory. All that
need be noticed in this place is that, according to what is called the
“scientific” school, the actual cause of those affections is <i>dirt</i>, and
apparently <i>dirt</i> alone. According to the practical school, the <i>causes</i>
are various, including the youth of the men, translation to an alien
climate and alien conditions, exposure, indiscretions, etc. In accordance
with the views first-named, numerous works to which the term
“sanitary” was applied were undertaken at a cost to the Indian
Government of many thousands, nay millions, of rupees. According to
the second, many of those expensive improvements have been without<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_309" id="Page_309">309</a></span>
their intended result, nor have they in any degree touched the root and
origin of the evil, comprised in the general conditions just named.</p>

<p>The king of Burmah having died, the legal heir Thebaw was duly
acknowledged his successor. No sooner had he attained to power
than acts of maladministration and of atrocity drew upon him extreme
displeasure of the Indian Government. Milder measures having
proved ineffectual, a military force was sent to his capital, with the
result that in due time it was captured, he himself deposed, and
brought to India as prisoner of State. For a considerable time before
that expedition was dispatched, preparatory arrangements for such a
contingency had been as far as practicable matured&mdash;&#8203;those of the
department under my own supervision included.</p>

<p>Relations between the Government of India and the Ameer of
Affghanistan had been in a more or less strained condition since 1873,
when “after the return of Noor Mahomed Shah from Simla, the
Ameer’s language was very unsatisfactory” to Lord Northbrook. “A
sum of £100,000 placed to the Ameer’s credit at Peshawur by the
British Government was allowed to remain there, and never <span class="locked">drawn.”<a name="FNanchor_340" id="FNanchor_340" href="#Footnote_340" class="fnanchor">340</a></span>
During the early months of 1878 the general state of those relations
was much discussed in military society and in civil, two different views
being expressed regarding it: the one by officers and others of long
Indian experience and practical acquaintance with frontier matters; the
other, chiefly by those of shorter Indian experience, and less practical
acquaintance on the border.</p>

<p>Later in that year, our much-esteemed Commander-in-Chief, Sir
Neville Chamberlain, was ordered by Lord Lytton to proceed as Envoy
to Sheer Ali, the Ameer. He did so, and now the Madras command
fell during his absence to General Elmhirst, formerly of the 9th Foot,
a good officer and amiable man. After much ineffectual negotiation by
Sir Neville Chamberlain, in the hope of averting armed intervention,
Lord Lytton declared war against the Ameer. Forces were meanwhile
being gathered for the purpose of the campaign, the 67th Regiment
with some other troops being sent from the Madras Presidency.
Their equipment and the general arrangements for active service had
to be provided under orders of the responsible officers concerned, of
whom I was one. In due time, Sir Neville was received with welcome
back from the important, but unhappily futile, mission upon which he
had been sent.</p>

<p>While the general subject of young soldiers <i>versus</i> old was occupying
the War Office authorities, the opinions held regarding it from personal
experience of certain senior officers were called for, mine among them.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_310" id="Page_310">310</a></span>
To a number of definite questions, definite answers were submitted by
us individually; but the tone of all was identical,&mdash;&#8203;namely, that for the
purpose of field service in India men of mature growth, and who had
already been some years in the country, were most capable of withstanding
the wear and tear incidental to war. Sufficient grounds for that
opinion are casually stated in reference to incidents relating to the
Mutiny campaign, and to the Siege of Paris.</p>

<p>In connection with the same subject, the question arose whether or
not advantage might accrue from the introduction of a double system
of recruiting; namely, short service for home, long service for India.
Some of us elaborated a series of calculations, the outcome of which
was that on the score of expense, including pensions, the latter scheme
would be more economical than the system, then as still in operation,
involving as it does the constant influx and efflux of men to and
from India, the maintenance of expensive systems of transport, hill
stations and sanatoria. This, however, is but one among several
points relating to the important question now touched upon.</p>

<p>The process of “divorcing” medical officers from regiments had
become general, notwithstanding representations and protests from men
of long experience. In the early part of the nineteenth century, the
defects incidental to “general” hospitals and methods relating thereto
having declared themselves in the Peninsular campaign, what was
called the regimental system was introduced in addition to, and
partial supersession of that method, the better to meet the requirement
professionally of the several classes pertaining to regiments. With
the abolition of that system a retrograde step is taken, to the serious disadvantage
of the soldier and all other persons concerned. No sufficient
reason exists why the double system, staff and regimental, should not
continue as before, and so fulfil alike the purposes of war and of peace.</p>

<p>Inspection duty to military stations within the command occupied
the greater part of each “cold” season. In the performance of this
somewhat invidious function, the agreeable far outbalanced the unpleasant,
hospitality and every consideration by the officers with whom
I came in contact going far to make each such tour a pleasure trip.</p>

<p>Barracks, hospitals, and other buildings for accommodation or other
use by soldiers had recently been erected in accordance with plans
and instructions formulated by the Sanitary Commission in Calcutta,
of which I was a member, as already mentioned. In the majority of
instances they had been in use by the troops during six to eight years;
but so far, liability to endemic illness of their occupants showed no
decrease statistically from what had occurred among occupants of “the
old style” of barracks. With regard to several other matters connected<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_311" id="Page_311">311</a></span>
with them, evidence was apparent that anticipations by that Commission
had yet to be realized.</p>

<p>Beyond the objects of routine duty there was much of interest connected
with the majority of places visited. On the west coast the
history of what are now civil or military stations carries us back to a
period when Tadmor in the wilderness, the ancient Palmyra, was a
depôt for merchandise and goods imported in the days of Solomon
from this part of India. It was off Calicut, at which there is now
stationed a small force of British troops, that in May, 1498, Vasco da
Gama came to anchor after a voyage of eleven months from Lisbon.
In 1509, Albuquerque having failed in one attack upon that place proceeded
to Goa, which he captured, and has ever since that time
remained in Portuguese possession.</p>

<p>Cannanore, situated further up along the Malabar coast, is also a
place of great antiquity, though now of small importance. From the
days of Pliny, and long before then, the inhabitants of the whole district
so named were known to be sea robbers and wreckers. At the present
day, however, the descendants of those early pirates may be seen quietly
at study, and learning useful handicrafts in the establishments belonging
to the Basel Mission, which are in a very flourishing condition, if we
can form an opinion on the subject from a cursory visit to them.</p>

<p>An isolated military post is Maliapuram, situated in a district mostly
covered with dense jungle, at the distance of a night’s journey from
Calicut. The result to me of the trip there and back through malarious
forests was an attack of illness, recovery from which was due to
the hospitable attentions received from Mr. and Mrs. Wigram. The
object of the little garrison alluded to is to preserve peace among the
Moplas, a manly, lawless race, whose descent is believed to be from
Arab sailors who, in ancient times, formed connections with native
(Tier) women. They are noted for their zeal as Mahomedans, for the
rapidity with which “risings” take place among them, and the bloodshed
incidental to those occasions.</p>

<p>Bangalore has been already mentioned in these notes. The large
cantonment for British troops, in respect to completeness of arrangements,
is unsurpassed in India. In near proximity to it is the residence
of the representative of Government at the Court of Mysore.</p>

<p>From this place the routine usually is to proceed to Bellary, situated
in the centre of the Indian Peninsula. Smaller than Bangalore, yet of
considerable importance, it is the military centre of the Berar district,
assigned in 1853 to the Government of India represented by Lord
Dalhousie on account of certain subsidies then in arrear on the part of
the Nizam.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_312" id="Page_312">312</a></span>
Secunderabad, perhaps the largest military station in India, is situated
at a distance of nine to twelve miles from Hyderabad. That important
native city was visited after duty had been gone through, the visit
performed on elephants, a guard of sowars furnished for our safe conduct;
nor was the precaution unnecessary, if an opinion could be
gathered from the expression of men’s countenances as we proceeded
along the narrow winding streets. Our excursion was varied by a short
trip by steam launch on the Meer Alum tank, and afterwards by a
short visit to the mosques at Golconda.</p>

<p>An unpleasant duty connected with my position, but one which
fortunately had only at rare intervals to be performed, was that of reporting
otherwise than favourably on officers within my sphere of superintendence.
Such occasions only arose at the periodical inspections,
and then the method I adopted was to read to the officer concerned
the portion of the usual official report relating to the particular point
commented upon, requesting him at the same time to furnish his
explanation regarding it, so that the explanatory document should be
transmitted together with the adverse comment. Otherwise, as it
seemed to me, an injury would be inflicted without the officer concerned
being aware of the grounds or extent of it, and without an opportunity
being afforded him to defend himself. In fact, the whole system of
“confidential” reports is open to very grave objection, as by their
very nature they more or less “strike a man in the dark.”</p>

<p>In some instances, fortunately of rare occurrence, it was found that
an officer, previously known to be zealous, painstaking, and otherwise
efficient, suddenly displayed impatience of administrative control, and
in other respects brought himself unpleasantly before the authorities.
In the course of experience I came to know various instances in which
the sudden change alluded to was in reality the premonitor of illness;
others in which it was the first indication of actual disease; consequently
I was at the outset prepared to look upon such a change in
one or other of these lights. This remark may apply to all classes of
officers, more especially in the tropics, and I believe that much unnecessary
disciplinary severity towards individuals under such circumstances
could be with advantage exchanged for more considerate
methods.</p>

<p>In my own branch of the general service, and in others, I had various
opportunities of seeing the results of so-called “sweeping” reforms by
“new brooms” and particular officers whose moving principle seemed
to be that whatever is, is wrong, and therefore must be abolished.
Happily for the personal comfort of all concerned, and for the benefit
of the service as a whole, the great majority of administrative officers<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_313" id="Page_313">313</a></span>
have learnt that reasons are forthcoming, if sought for, to account for
whatever may not be at first sight evident in reference to particular
modes of routine; therefore the officer of experience, as opposed to the
mere “reformer,” endeavours, in the first place, to ascertain the nature
of those conditions, and having done so, to introduce slowly and
gradually such changes as altered conditions may suggest.</p>

<p>There are certain other points relating to administration which I
may note. I had long ago become aware that in conducting duties,
the making of promises other than such as could there and then be
performed is a bad one; circumstances are apt to arise which render
it quite impossible to carry out those made in anticipation. In such
cases great disappointment and often chagrin to the officer concerned
was the result. Very bitterly as a young man had I felt rough and
cavalier action towards me by senior and official superiors. It was
accordingly my endeavour to avoid similar demeanour towards my
juniors. In communicating expressions of official dissatisfaction, it
was an object of my endeavour to avoid giving such an expression the
tone of personality.</p>

<p>During the greater part of the five years comprising my tour of
service in the Madras Presidency, my family occupied a house in Ooty,
for by that almost loving abbreviation was Ootacamund known. There
my wife and daughter remained continuously, their occupation and
enjoyment comprising horses, dogs, a farmyard, and garden. Thither
in the hot season I repaired, as one of the officials entitled to that
great privilege; and there, while carrying on departmental duties,
I was able to participate in the various occupations and enjoyments
special to the place. Among those were rides, drives, excursions,
and picnics, visits to various Government and other gardens and
plantations, including tea gardens; while to a lover of nature there was
a never-failing source of interest in the phases of plant and animal life
as we rode or walked along the various mountain faces by which the
station was encircled.</p>

<p>Society was pervaded by a spirit of sociability and friendliness; that
tone given to it by its leaders, the Ladies Grenville and Lady Chamberlain.
Official duty was conducted in a spirit of kind consideration
between officials, at the same time that it was well and honestly performed.
It was, then, with great regret that my period drew to a close;
that having ended, my “relief” arrived. My five years in the Madras
Presidency were indeed “the green spot” in my somewhat long period
of service. In December, 1879, I embarked for England.</p>

<p>In the early days of January, 1880, we landed at Southampton,
whence we proceeded to Portsmouth, to which district I found myself<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_314" id="Page_314">314</a></span>
again appointed. It was now the dead of winter. The rapid change
from the heat of Madras to the bitter cold of this part of England
caused severe illness in the person of my dear wife&mdash;&#8203;a circumstance
which gave rise to a fellow-feeling for the many soldiers’ wives and
children who undergo the same transition between extremes, but without
sufficient provision in clothing and other requisites to enable them
to withstand its effects. The routine of duty was much the same as it
had been some ten years previous; the one respect in which a change
was visible referred to my own special department, into which alterations
introduced seemed to tend neither to the well-being of the soldier
nor comfort of the officer.</p>

<p>My period of service drew to a close under the terms of a recently
issued Royal warrant. Arrangements were made accordingly for
handing over to a successor duties the performance of which had
become in a manner second nature to me, so much so that their
cessation was looked forward to as a blank in prospect. In the early
days of April the Army Estimates for the current year were published.
In accordance with them I was one of six to whom was authorized
the reward for “Distinguished Military Services.” On May 25, as
the clock struck the hour of noon, I resigned my seat to the officer
ordered to relieve me. In the succeeding <i>Gazette</i> the notification
appeared that I was placed on retired pay. My active career was
ended.</p>

<p>[P.S.&mdash;&#8203;In the Jubilee <i>Gazette</i>, 1897, the distinction of K.C.B. was
conferred upon me. On August 11 following, at Osborne, Her Most
Gracious Majesty was pleased to invest me with the Insignia of the
Order. On December 2 I had the additional honour of receiving
the Jubilee medal, transmitted by command of the Queen, to be worn
in commemoration of the sixtieth anniversary of Her Majesty’s Reign.]</p>

events of 1857, writes:&mdash;&#8203;In reply to the question, “Is there any chance of a mutiny
occurring again?” With reference to that question he, remarks after this manner:
“I would say that the best way of guarding against such a calamity is&mdash;&#8203;By
never allowing the present proportion of British to native soldiers to be diminished
or the discipline and efficiency of the native army to become slack.
</p>
<p>
“By taking care that men are selected for the higher civil and military posts
whose self-reliance, activity, and resolution are not impaired by age, and who possess
a knowledge of the country and the habits of the peoples.
</p>
<p>
“By recognising and guarding against the dogmatism of theorists and the dangers
of centralization.
</p>
<p>
“By rendering our administration on the one hand firm and strong, on the other
hand tolerant and sympathetic; and last, but not least, by doing all in our power to
gain the confidence of the various races, and by convincing them that we have not
only the determination, but the ability to maintain our supremacy in India against
all assailants.
</p>
<p>
“If these cardinal points are never lost sight of, there is, I believe, little chance
of any fresh outbreak disturbing the stability of our rule in India, or neutralizing our
efforts to render that country prosperous, contented, and thoroughly loyal to the
British Crown.” (Vol. I., p. 449.)</p></div>

which the great majority of the people belong. The direct effect of that observance
is said to be the breaking of confidence between members of the same family, and so
on upwards throughout public, as in private life. In connection with this allegations
made by so many with whom I had communication, the circumstance is significant
that whenever and for whatever political end a “Revolution” takes place in Paris,
the class of persons who are first and invariably attacked are the clergy of that
particular denomination.</p></div>

<h2 class="nobreak">Transcribers’ Notes</h2>

<p>Punctuation, hyphenation, and spelling were made consistent when a predominant
preference was found in this book; otherwise they were not changed.</p>

<p>Simple typographical errors were corrected; occasional unbalanced
quotation marks retained.</p>

<p>Ambiguous hyphens at the ends of lines were retained.</p>

<p>Index not checked for proper alphabetization or correct page references.</p>

<p>Text uses both “via” and “viâ”, and other word-variants with and without
accents.</p>

<p>Page <a href="#Page_147">147</a>: “the Moulvie already mentioned” was printed as “mention”;
changed here.</p>

<p>Page <a href="#Page_241">241</a>: “probable casualties. Thus” was printed with a comma;
changed here.</p>

<p>Page <a href="#Page_251">251</a>: “and it was impossible” was printed without the “was”;
changed here.</p>

<p>Page <a href="#Page_276">276</a>: “glimering” was printed that way.</p>

<p>Page <a href="#Page_303">303</a>: The reference to Footnote 333 (originally “2”) was missing,
and has been added in a plausible place by the Transcriber.</p>

<p>In the <a href="#INDEX">Index</a>, the sub-entries under <a href="#paris">Paris</a> all belong
under “Paris” itself; they are not sub-entries of “Sieges of”.</p>

<p>The footnotes, originally at the bottoms of pages, have been collected
and moved to follow the last chapter, just before the Index.</p>
